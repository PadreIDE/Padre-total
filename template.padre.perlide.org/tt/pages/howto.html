<h1>How to?</h1>
<p>
The following howto entries are meant to go through step-by-step various tasks 
that can be done with Padre. We plan to extend these and add screenshots to
aid the learning process and later to turn some of them into screencasts.

<h1>Getting Started with Padre on Windows</h1>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Download Padre 0.41 from <a href="download.html">download</a> the name of the file to be saved on 
      the desktop is called almost-six-0.41.msi <!--  (TODO have a clearer name of the package on the website)--></li>
  <li>Run this installer by double clicking on the icon.</li>
  <li>It will ask you to accept the terms. Once you did that you can press the Install button.</li>
  <li>Once installation is finished you should be able to see the installed icons by pressing 
     on "Start" then on "Programs" and then selecting "Padre Standalone Plus Six".</li>
  <li>The package you downloaded is the latest version packaged for Windows but there are 
      newer versions of Padre on CPAN. You should now upgrade by doing the following:
      Click on "Start", "Run", copy the following command and press ENTER:
      <!--(TODO: Padre, or the installation should have an icon that upgrads Padre)
      (Better yet, it should wrap a small wx application that shows a progressbar 
      by default on which one can select to see details which would show the text 
      as it is printed to the console that can be killed if the installations gets stuck.)-->
      <br />
    <code>perl -MCPAN -e "CPAN->upgrade('/^Padre/')"</code><br />
    This will open a black window. You'll see text printed in that 
    window while Padre is being upgraded. The process will take 4-5 minutes 
    or a lot more if your Internet connection is slow.
    </li>
    <li>Run Padre by clicking on "Start", selecting "Programs", 
       selecting "Padre Standalone Plus Six" and clicking on "Padre". 
       (there will be two windows, a black console and the editor itself).
       This is considered a bug and it will be fixed in a future version. <!-- (TODO eliminate black window)-->
    </li>
    <li>Close the Output window (Uncheck View/Show Output) <!-- (TODO set this the default) --></li>
    <li>Select "Plugins", "Plugin Manager", you should see a list of plugins. 
      Please make sure at least the the "Perl 6" plugin is enabled but it would 
      be better to enable the "Padre Developer Tools" Plugin and the 
      "Padre Popularity Contest" plugin as well.</li>
    <li>Select "Edit", "Preferences", "Run Parameters" and make sure 
        "Use external window for execution" is checked. (the word xterm will be gone in the next version)</li>
    <li>Click on "Files and Colors" (in older versions it was called "Mime-types").
        Select the Perl 6 as "File type" and select "STD.pm" as Highlighter.</li>
    <li>Click on "Save"</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Help for problem solving:<br />

run "Start", "Run", type in "cmd" and press enter. In the black window type  <code>echo %PATH%</code> then type <code>perl -V</code>
