<h2>Contacting the Padre developers</h2>
<p>
Padre is an open source project with many participants.
There are two main channels to contact us.
Via chat (using <acronym>IRC</acronym>) and on our mailing list.

<h2><acronym>IRC</acronym> channel</h2>
<p>
The primary communication channel is the <acronym>IRC</acronym> channel of the Padre developers. It is located
on the <code>irc.perl.org</code> server and it is called <code>#padre</code>. You can use either an <acronym>IRC</acronym> client
if you have one on your computer or the web-based Mibbit <acronym>IRC</acronym> client. For the formers
you would want to click on <a href="irc://irc.perl.org/#padre">this link</a>. If you prefer
to use the web based client the you can follow the link to the
<a href="http://widget.mibbit.com/?server=irc.perl.org&amp;channel=%23padre">web based <acronym>IRC</acronym> client to #padre</a>.
After clicking on that link you will be prompted to give a nickname. The field is filled by
a random name that you can leave as it is though it is probably better to select
a nickname that fits your personalty.
</p>
<p>
After clicking on the <i>Connect</i> button you will see the #padre <acronym>IRC</acronym> channel. First it will
print some welcome information that you can usually disregard and then you will be able to say
hi by just typing it and pressing enter. Then you can proceed to ask your question.
</p>
<p>
After asking a question please be patient as the people might be busy doing other
things so it can take some time till someone responds.

<h2>Mailing list</h2>
<p>
The Padre development mailing list is another way to ask for help.
It is usually slower than <acronym>IRC</acronym> but it also means you don't have to
be connected to the channel while waiting someone to answer your
questions. To join the mailing list please visit the registration page
of the <a href="http://mail.perlide.org/mailman/listinfo/padre-dev"><code>padre-dev</code></a>
mailing list.
