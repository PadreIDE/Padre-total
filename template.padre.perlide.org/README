Might contain something useful soon.
Or not.


The pages of http://padre.perlide.org/ are generated by these scripts and
templates.


Developers page:
  1) add an ini file in the data/developers/  directory
  2) add the nickname to the developers: section of data/stash.yml

Translators page:
  1) add an ini file in the data/translators/  directory
  2) add the nickname to the tranalastors: section of data/stash.yml


The idea that eveyone involved (including translators, packagers, testers etc)
add themselves to the developers page in English.
The translators page should be written in the respective languages of the 
relevant people.


About page
  The list of blog entries is maintained manually in data/stash.yml



The site is generated by running   

    perl build/all.pl

currently on every commit so every update to the templates will show up immediately.

As a precaution the build/all.pl script that is the only executable one 
should only be updated manually by Gabor, so if you make changes to that file, 
please ping him on IRC.


documentroot/  contains static files
tt/            contains the Template Toolkit templates
resources/     contains source files that are used to manually generate some 
               of the files in the documentroot/ directory.
