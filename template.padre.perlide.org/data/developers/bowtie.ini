[Who]
<p> I am primarily a dyslexic technologist, with a history in e-mail and biometrics among other things,
who just likes to ferret around until I find what I am looking for, then latch on like a Jack Russell, 
until it works or I understand why not.
</p>

[Why]
<p>
Perl is just something I liked along the way, just as Open Source is. 
</p>
<p>
So I thought it was time to give something back, so here I am.
</p>


[What]
<p>
It all started with a wiki page, thanks GÃ¡bor, put my own <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a> up so that I could hack around, 
and just started to update pages documenting how Padre worked as I went along, creating tickets in my wake.
</p>
<p>
Then I had this bright idea, or not, 
which turned into <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/PadrePluginDialog/">Padre::Plugin::Cookbook</a> 
out of which came <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/Features/EditPatch/">Patch</a>, it started as a Plugin. 

</p>
<p>
My current focus is with <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/Features/Perl5Debugger/">Debug2</a> 
and it's dependency <code>Debug::Client</code> and the current bleadperl anomalies.
