[Who]
 <p>
 I am a full-time Java programmer who enjoys playing with Perl in the
 free time. I like the creative freedom, challenges and valuable experience
 that open source projects provide to programmers out there for FREE!
 </p>

[Why]
<p>
 I was working on a Perl 6 syntax highlighter when I heard about
 GÃ¡bor's <acronym>TPF</acronym> Perl 6 Grant. Naturally, I offered to help out and now I am the
 co-maintainer of <code>Padre::Plugin::Perl6</code> with him. My goal is to co-develop a
 state-of-the-art Perl 6 <acronym>IDE</acronym>.
</p>

[What]
<p>
I am re-writing <code>Syntax::Highlight::Perl6</code> to provide better <acronym>PPI</acronym>-like <acronym>API</acronym>.
Afterwards, we can provide better Perl 6 refactoring support.
I also wrote <code>Padre::Plugin::Ecliptic</code> to support my ambitious goal of porting
useful Eclipse features into Padre.
