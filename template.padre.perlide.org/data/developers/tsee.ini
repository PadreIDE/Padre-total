[Who]
<p> doesn't think he's all that interesting. If you must know, he's a physicist who enjoys
writing non-physics software in his spare time.</p>

[Why]
<p>
I'm the maintainer of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PAR">PAR</a> suite of modules.
Originally, I wanted to use the opportunity of a new application to create a PAR-based
plug-in system. Then I had a drink with Gábor at YAPC::EU 2009 in Copenhagen.
That's where it went downhill...</p>
<p>More seriously, I simply enjoy being able to modify and customize the tools I use
to get work done.</p>


[What]
<p>
I designed the concurrency system around Padre::Task, put together the PAR support for plug-ins,
and wrote most of the Perl-specific refactoring support code using Adam's wonderful PPI module.
Adding more "smart" refactoring tools is currently my highest priority.
