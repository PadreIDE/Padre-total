[Why]
<p>
I've been using emacs since the mid-90s (although I'm no expert) and have never been able to find anything else I can work happily with, but elisp makes my brane hurt, and cperl-mode struggles with the increasingly large and complex perl applications I've been building recently - I'm looking for an alternative.<br/>
Because Padre is easily extendable in a language I speak almost natively (Perl), and because it's lighter and faster than most of the other GUI editors I've tried, it's not only my best hope of replacing emacs, but also fun and immediately rewarding to hack on both the editor itself and plugins.</p>
<p>Although I don't use Padre for day-to-day development, I will be soon - once I'm happy with version control integration and emacs keymapping, I'll be switching to it full time (which is 7.5 hours a day, 340 days a year).
</p>

[What]
<p>I've done some small mods to Padre itself to enable further work on keymapping in plugins, I'm working on the EmacsMode plugin that provides emacs style keymapping, and plan on integrating <a href="http://www.aarontrevena.co.uk/opensource/autodia/index.html">Autodia</a> through another plugin some time soon.
