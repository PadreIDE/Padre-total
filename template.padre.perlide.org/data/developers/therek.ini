[Who]
<p>... is a UNIX system administrator using Perl for fun and profit.</p>

[Why]
<p>
Because I'm bored with constant quarrels how Perl belongs to the past
and that it don't even have an <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>.
I think supplying the IDE written in Perl itself is appropriate answer
for such accusations.</p>
<p>As for <em>how I got involved</em>, Gabor made me :) He gave me
a commit bit!</p>

[What]
<p>
I'm writing small pieces of code here and there, like in Run or Find/Replace parts.
Apart from that, I'm maintaining <a href="http://www.freshports.org/editors/p5-Padre/">Padre port for FreeBSD</a>.
