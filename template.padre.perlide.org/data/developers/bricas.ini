[Why]
<p>I've always wanted an editor with deep Perl integration. This project also
satisfies my curiosity for cross-platform <acronym>GUI</acronym> apps.
</p>

[What]
<p>I've taken the lead in making sure the <code>PerlTidy</code> plug-in follows all of the
new developments in the Padre-sphere. Next on the docket, a settings dialog
to customize your <code>PerlTidy</code> settings.</p>
