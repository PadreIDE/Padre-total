[Who]
<p>is enjoying programming perl</p>

[Why]
 <p>
i've been long using vi, them emacs, then vi again. i always wanted a
perl ide, designed around perl programming - and not added as an after
thought. padre has a huge potential wrt this expectation. and being
programmed in perl allows me to fix what i dislike in it...
 </p>

[What]
 <p>
when i'm working on padre (which happens by bursts), i'm touching a lot
of different parts of the codebase: the plugin manager and the sessions
are my fault, so is the i18n plugin api. i'm fixing stuff that annoy
me, try to sanitize fishy stuff (removing circular dependencies, etc)
and document things that i'm forced to dig into... generally, i'm
checking the bug tracker on a regular basis and try to pick &amp; close
random bugs. i also contributed a few plugins, and maintain padre's
french translation.
