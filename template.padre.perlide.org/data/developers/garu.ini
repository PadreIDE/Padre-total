[Why]
<p>Even though I'm a "vi/vim" kind of guy for as long as I can remember, the
idea of having an actual free and open-source Integrated Development
Environment for Perl always tempted my imagination, specially when I see
what such tool can do for beginners. So, when Gabor started Padre, I felt
naturally attracted to the project. I first started translating Padre to
pt_BR, and next thing I know I'm fixing bugs and committing new features.
</p>
<p>These guys here are just too nice, it's all their fault.</p>

[What]
<p>I maintain the Brazilian Portuguese translation, and fix some bugs when
I find them. Right now I'm looking into toolbar customization and better
ways to use wxPerl for the project. I also created and maintain the Catalyst
and Mojolicious plugins for Padre.
