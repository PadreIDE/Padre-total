[Who]
 <p>I am a historian/linguist/UNIX admin/programmer/dad with not enough time but who loves Perl.</p>

[Why]
<p>Blame the friendly people on IRC (#padre)! In fact I was tired of the "Perl is dead" FUD and Padre is a very positive
answer to it. I like the idea of an IDE written in the same language that it targets so I can fix my own bugs.
At the same time, I learn a lot from great Perl hackers working on the project. FOSS software has given me so much (my profession
and hobby), so for me this is a very small payback.
</p>

[What]
<p>
Nothing big. My speciality is just using Padre and suggesting new features that we need :). Once on a while I implement one of
these small features myself like the "Toggle Comment" feature. Because I am one of those crazy people combining a day job in IT with
a PhD on a unrelated field (Linguistics and Literature) and having small kids at the same time, I don't have a lot of time. Nevertheless,
I try to do 'svn commit' from time to time.
