[Who]
 <p> has been using Perl to get things done at work for years.  Has always been amazed at what some open source projects
 achieve and those involved in it.
 </p>

[Why]
<p>
Perl IDE for Perl developers?  Awesome!
</p>
<p>
I've long wanted to see such a thing.  I have used various editors for perl, vim, Notepad, PFE, and prior to Padre, Notepad++.
I watched with some interest the emerging Padre and jumped in quite early, finding that for most things it just worked.  The syntax 
checking the highlighting was great.
</p>
<p>
I hung out in #padre and whinged about things that didn't work.  I was told to raise tickets in trac.
</p>
<p>
When I submitted my first patch and it was accepted and applied, I was hooked!!!
</p>
<p>
Here was a project I could contribute to.
</p>

[What]
<p>
My first real attempt at something was with minor annoyances with Padre::DocBrowser.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise it's low hanging fruit like adding a dialog to the find dialog when it doesn't find what you are after.
</p>
<p>
My current focus is with Padre::Plugin::SVN of which I just packaged up and released Padre-Plugin-SVN-0.02 to CPAN.
