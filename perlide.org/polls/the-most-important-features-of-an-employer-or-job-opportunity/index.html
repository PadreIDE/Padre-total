<p>
Recently I talked to many people about an idea on how to improve the communication between
companies using Perl and the open source Perl community. On one hand many managers at companies told 
me the number one problem they are facing with Perl is that they cannot find good Perl developers. 
On the other hand many good Perl developers I know complain that there are no good Perl jobs on the market.
</p>
<p>
What is the reason for this contradiction? Is this because the job opportunities are in different locations than the developers? 
Is this because there is a gap in the meaning of "good Perl developer" and "good Perl job"?
</p>
<p>
In order to try to understand the problem I created a small poll trying to figure out what are the 
expectations of a Perl developer from an employer or a job opportunity.
</p>
<p>
In addition to this poll I am also preparing a white paper for companies to help them understand
how they can find more and better Perl developers. If you are interested in it or you would like
your boss to read it, please <a href="http://szabgab.com/contact.html">let me know.</a>

The low percentages need an explanation. We allowed every visitor to give 8 answers but the system only counts
answers and not voters. The total number of answers was 1,570. That could mean any number of voters between
1,570/8 = 196 up till 1,570 but it is likely to be close to 200-220. So it means the 178 votes on "Reasonable salary"
probably represents about 80-90% of the voters.

<p>
The poll ran from 8 May 2010 till 15 May.

It was promoted via a 
<a href="http://szabgab.com/blog/2010/05/1273416855.html">blog entry about the poll</a>,
in the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=40830">Perl Mongers group on LinkedIN</a>
the <a href="http://twitter.com/szabgab">Twitter account of Gabor Szabo</a>, on the IRC channel of <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a>
and on some of the <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Monger</a> mailing lists.
</p>

<p>
There were a couple of external responses. For example Pavel I. Shaydo responded on 
<a href="http://trinitum.org/wp/important-features-of-employer">his own blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
There were a couple of interesting posts in the 
<a href="http://mail.perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2010-May/010949.html">thread on the Israel.pm</a> mailing list.
