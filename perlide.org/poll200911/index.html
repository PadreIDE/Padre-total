<h1>What other technologies, languages, templating systems are you using besides Perl?</h1>
<p>
A month ago I asked you <a href="/poll200910/">what editor or IDE are you using for writing Perl code</a>. 
While almost 50% of the votes went to vi or emacs and are unlikely to change that, we in the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre development team</a> 
belive that there are many people who are not that satisfied with the current development environment they have. So we are trying to 
build an environment that for some people will be better for Perl development. Along with that objective we would like to make 
sure that your editor won't be narrow minded and will support other languages as well. We would like to provide at least syntax highlighting
to the languages and formats you are using. If possible we will go further and provide additional tools for you to make it
easy to work with those languages.
