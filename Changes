        via middle mouse button now works (HJANSEN)
    Unifying Padre->inst and Padre->ide (ADAMK)
    Complete rewrite of the configuration layer. All access to configuration

        customisation of the interface. (ADAMK)
    Completely refactored all of the config setting names (ADAMK)
    Added first-class configuration support for Plugins (ADAMK)
    Moved config data on bookmarks, plugins and historical search/replace
        strings out of the config file and into the database. (ADAMK)
    The output window now understands the color and font-face
        related ANSI control sequences (SMUELLER)
    The long-awaited MainWindow.pm -> Main.pm (ADAMK)
    Heavily modified many variables and method names to bring a greater
       simplicity and consistency to various APIs. Only possible because
       we were already breaking the config system and Main.pm (ADAMK)
    Removed some classes and other code that had (astonishingly for such a
        young application) become useless and bit-rotten (ADAMK)
    Added styles for text/x-patch, text/x-makefile, text/x-yaml,
        text/css, text/plain(apache conf) file types (KEEDI)
    Now style config file supports foreground, background, bold,
        italic, eolfilled, underline properties (KEEDI)

    Expanded the variety and depth of functionality available in the
        bundled "Padre Developer Tools" plugin (ADAMK)
    Our unattributed redistribution of tango was probably illegal,
        and made us incompatible with Debian. Switch to gnome for
        now. They are as ugly as sin, but at least they're legal (ADAMK)
    All big MainWindow gui elements are now in their own classes,
        which should help us spread out feature logic properly (ADAMK)
    Moved Padre::Plugin::CPAN functionality into the core so that
        we can do various sorts of tighter CPAN integration (ADAMK)
    Padre::Wx::DocBrowser now uses Padre::Task::DocBrowser (let's 
        hope properly) (Andrew Bramble)
    Class correction Padre::Wx::Menu -> Padre::Wx::Menubar (ADAMK)
    Class correction Padre::Wx::Submenu -> Padre::Wx::Menu (ADAMK)
    Now that Padre::DocBrowser has landed, delete the Padre::Pod
        family of modules (ADAMK)
    Automatic indentation style detection now the default (SMUELLER)
    User interface now "locked" by default (SMUELLER)
    Updated Italian translation (SBLANDIN)
    Addition of contextual (un-) commenting (CLAUDIO)

v0.24 2009.01.06

        matches the behaviour of the Ultraedit implementation (ADAMK)
    Updated German translation (HJANSEN)
    Replace Padre::Pod::Frame with Padre::Wx::DocBrowser, hopefully
        making help more helpful. (Andrew Bramble)
    Moving to the glorious RFC4646-based second-generation Padre::Locale
        implementation. "Portugese" is no longer Brazilian :) (ADAMK)
    Added a friendly icon to the ToolBar that displays the status
        (idle, running, high load) of the background tasks (SMUELLER)
    Created Padre::Current, which should simplify everything that needs
        to know about the current whatever (ADAMK)
    Used Padre::Current to kill off the slightly out of place non-class
        Padre::Documents (ADAMK)
    View Document As... (FAYLAND)

v0.23 2009.01.04

    Updated Italian transation.
    Refactored the plugin state hash out into a standalone
        Padre::PluginHandle class (ADAMK)

    Portuguese (Brazilian) translation added (GARU)
    Spanish translation added (PacoLinux)
    Shutdown process now delays saving the session until after the
        interface phase (ADAMK)
    Shutdown process now disables all the plugins, so they have a
        change to shut down elegantly too (ADAMK)
    Plugins now reload correctly (ADAMK)
    Created a basic stub Padre::Manual and moved the information in
        HACKING.txt into Padre::Manual::Hacking and
	Padre::Manual::Translation (ADAMK)
    Moved more bits of GUI code out of MainWindow and into their own
        classes (ADAMK)

v0.22 2008.12.23

    Various Perl6 and Parrot related snippets of code and
        functionality have been moved to the respective
        plugins (SZABGAB and others)

Note: If you are having issues running Padre after upgrading to 0.21,
      ("Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_window_set_modal: assertion `GTK_IS_WINDOW (window)' failed")
      try moving or deleting your $HOME/.padre directory and check
      whether that fixes the issues. YMMV and let us know about any

        class, with independant ->refresh methods and much improved
        encapsulation as a result. (ADAMK)
    Rewrote the Padre bootstrap sequence. Not only does Padre start in
        a more sane order, but with some additional tweaks using

        and shuts down much much faster (ADAMK)

    Various portability and miscellaneous fixes to the syntax checker
        (ADAMK, HJANSEN)
    Add new Perl-specific feature: "Jump to variable declaration"
        and the experimental "replace lexical variable". (SMUELLER)
