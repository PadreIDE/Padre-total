below (they fall under the same terms as Perl(!) itself) or have their
source individually documented and verified with licensing information

Note to Developers:

Make damn sure it stays that way!

  Clarification:

    The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for
    software libraries in the first place. We expressly want the LGPL to
    be valid for this artwork library too.

    KDE Oxygen theme icons is a special kind of software library, it is an
    artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or
    GUI.

    Source code, for this library means:
     - where they exist, SVG;
     - otherwise, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or
    otherwise png.

    The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
    notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful.

    With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
    containing the elements. You may follow this practice.

    The exception in section 5 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers
    the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
