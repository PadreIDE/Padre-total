NAME
    Module::Install::PadrePlugin - Module::Install support for Padre plugins

SYNOPSIS
    To add two useful "make" targets to your Padre plugin, just add the
    "is_padre_plugin;" line to your "Makefile.PL".

        use inc::Module::Install;
    
        name            'Padre::Plugin::Foo';
        all_from        'lib/Padre/Plugin/Foo.pm';
    
        is_padre_plugin;
     
        WriteAll;

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds one directive to Module::Install related to creating
    and installing Padre plugins as .par files and two "make" targets.

  is_padre_plugin
    If you add this directive to your "Makefile.PL", two new "make" targets
    become available to the user, see below.

NEW MAKE TARGETS
  plugin
    To generate a .par file from the Padre plugin at hand which can be
    easily installed (see also below) into your Padre user directory, you
    can simply type:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make plugin

    Now you should have a shiny new "FancyPlugin.par" file.

  installplugin
    To install the Padre plugin at hand as a single PAR file into your Padre
    user/plugins directory, you can simply type:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make installplugin

    Running "make plugin" in between those two command isn't necessary, it's
    run by "installplugin" if necessary.
