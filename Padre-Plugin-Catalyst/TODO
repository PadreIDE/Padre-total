Padre::Plugin::Catalyst - TODO list!

	* Make "Start Server" and "Stop Server" enable/disable themselves. Better yet,
	  make it just one button, changing labels and sub calls accordingly.
	
	* Maker 'stop server' work as if the user clicked on the stop button.
	  (That is, as long as the stop button works under win32)

	* Add some catalyst.pl project options, such as -makefile, -scripts and -short
	  Also add the option to change a project's config file format, running somehting
	  like: perl -Ilib -e 'use MyApp; use Config::General;
	        Config::General->new->save_file("myapp.conf", MyApp->config);
	
	* Before creating a new project, test if directory to-be-created already exists.
	  If so, ask the user if we should force it anyway
	  
	* Wait for server to actually start before issuing the pop-up window asking if
	 the user wants to open the web browser.
	
	* Add a plugin preferences window, including (but not limited to):
	  - user provided list of plugins to include automagically
	  - default view/model/controller helper to display
