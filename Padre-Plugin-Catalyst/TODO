Padre::Plugin::Catalyst - TODO list!

bug: no files open, selecting "new model"

    * jump from current action to corresponding template and back (zamolxes)
      --> look for the functions method or "find method declaration", maybe they have a good way to detect the method we're at.


    * option to add a new action + corresponding template + mechanize test (zamolxes)

    * some sort of integration with Catalyst::Dispatcher::AsGraph
    * an outline-like panel that showed all actions and where they resolve to (code-wise)

	* Add some catalyst.pl project options, such as -makefile, -scripts 
	  and -short. Also add the option to change a project's config file format, running something like: 
	  perl -Ilib -e 'use MyApp; use Config::General;
	  Config::General->new->save_file("myapp.conf", MyApp->config);
	
	* Before creating a new project, test if directory to-be-created 
	  already exists. If so, ask the user if we should force it anyway
	  
	* Wait for server to actually start before issuing the pop-up window 
	  asking if the user wants to open the web browser.
	
	* Add a plugin preferences window, including (but not limited to):
	  - user provided list of plugins to include automagically
	  - default view/model/controller helper to display
	  - test server options, such as "port" and "restart when files get 
		modified"
