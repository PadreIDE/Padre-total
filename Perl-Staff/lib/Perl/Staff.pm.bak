=head1 NAME

Perl::Staff - People working for Perl

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Actually this is just a list of people working as "Perl::Staff" on events
showing Perl to the outside world.

The Perl community is quite active but some kind of closed as few new people
join. "Outside world" are all people either using or not using Perl, but
not using the powerful Perl community resources like CPAN, Perlmonks and
others.

We created t-shirts with "Perl::Staff" printed on them first for CeBit 2010
in Germany and this is how Perl::Staff was born.

=head1 EXPORT

Anybody here may be exportable to other events, just talk to them if you
need help planning an event or need Perl::Staff for helping on the event.

=head1 IMPORT

If you want to become Perl::Staff and get listed here, just pick an event
where you'ld like to give a Perl talk or export Perl to non-community
people in any way. Join the events mailing list for more information on events
and how you could help, come to the event and we'll try to get you a
Perl::Staff t-shirt and add you to the list.
