I started the development of Padre as I believe Perl needs better 
tool both for those who use it as a secondary tool and also for 
those who write large projects without 10 years of experience in Perl.</li>

I've been using emacs since the mid-90s (although I'm no expert) and have never been able to find anything else I can work happily with, but elisp makes my brane hurt, and cperl-mode struggles with the increasingly large and complex perl applications I've been building recently - I'm looking for an alternative.<br/>
Because Padre is easily extendable in a language I speak almost natively (Perl), and because it's lighter and faster than most of the other GUI editors I've tried, it's not only my best hope of replacing emacs, but also fun and immediately rewarding to hack on both the editor itself and plugins.
<br/>
Although I don't use Padre for day-to-day development, I will be soon - once I'm happy with version control integration and emacs keymapping, I'll be switching to it full time (which is 7.5 hours a day, 340 days a year).
