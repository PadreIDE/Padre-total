has been using Perl since 1995 and teaching it since 2000. 
He has been involved in the Perl community since 2001 organizing
local Perl Monger meetings and conferences. Gabor is providing
Perl development and training services bot in in-house automation
and test automation.

<i>Why are you involved in Padre?</i><br/>
I started the development of Padre as I believe Perl needs better 
tools both for those who use it as a secondary tool and also for 
those who write large projects with or without 10 years of experience 
in Perl. I also hope it can be a springboard to learn Perl 6.
I used to use vim and gvim both on 
Linux and Windows but since the first release of Padre I have been
using it almost exclusively.

<p><i>Why are you involved in Padre?</i> <br/>
I've been using emacs since the mid-90s (although I'm no expert) and have never been able to find anything else I can work happily with, but elisp makes my brane hurt, and cperl-mode struggles with the increasingly large and complex perl applications I've been building recently - I'm looking for an alternative.<br/>
Because Padre is easily extendable in a language I speak almost natively (Perl), and because it's lighter and faster than most of the other GUI editors I've tried, it's not only my best hope of replacing emacs, but also fun and immediately rewarding to hack on both the editor itself and plugins.
<br/>
Although I don't use Padre for day-to-day development, I will be soon - once I'm happy with version control integration and emacs keymapping, I'll be switching to it full time (which is 7.5 hours a day, 340 days a year).
<p>
<i>What are you hacking on?</i><br /> I've done some small mods to Padre itself to enable further work on keymapping in plugins, I'm working on the EmacsMode plugin that provides emacs style keymapping, and plan on integrating <a href="http://www.aarontrevena.co.uk/opensource/autodia/index.html">Autodia</a> through another plugin some time soon.

doesn't think he's all that interesting. If you must know, he's a physicist who enjoys
writing non-physics software in his spare time.
<p>
<i>Why are you involved in Padre?</i><br/>
I'm the maintainer of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PAR">PAR</a> suite of modules.
Originally, I wanted to use the opportunity of a new application to create a PAR-based
plugin system. Then I had a drink with Gabor at YAPC::EU 2009 in Copenhagen.
That's where it went downhill...<br/>
More seriously, I simply enjoy being able to modify and customize the tools I use
to get work done.
</p>
<i>What are you hacking on?</i><br /> 
I designed the concurrency system around Padre::Task, put together the PAR support for plugins,
and wrote most of the Perl-specific refactoring support code using Adam's wonderful PPI module.
Adding more "smart" refactoring tools is currently my highest priority.
