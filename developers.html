 <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
 <p>
I've been using emacs since the mid-90s (although I'm no expert) and have never been able to find anything else I can work happily with, but elisp makes my brane hurt, and cperl-mode struggles with the increasingly large and complex perl applications I've been building recently - I'm looking for an alternative.<br/>
Because Padre is easily extendable in a language I speak almost natively (Perl), and because it's lighter and faster than most of the other GUI editors I've tried, it's not only my best hope of replacing emacs, but also fun and immediately rewarding to hack on both the editor itself and plugins.</p>
<p>Although I don't use Padre for day-to-day development, I will be soon - once I'm happy with version control integration and emacs keymapping, I'll be switching to it full time (which is 7.5 hours a day, 340 days a year).
</p>
<h2>What are you hacking on?</h2>
<p>I've done some small mods to Padre itself to enable further work on keymapping in plugins, I'm working on the EmacsMode plugin that provides emacs style keymapping, and plan on integrating <a href="http://www.aarontrevena.co.uk/opensource/autodia/index.html">Autodia</a> through another plugin some time soon.

 h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
 <p>10 years as an Ultraedit user have seen me go from enthusiast,
to ordinary user, to (attempted) contributor, to disgruntled user. It's
a great text editor, but for Perl developers the situation never
improves. Despite years of bug reporting and attempts to make my own
situation better, flaws that existed a decade ago continue to annoy me
regularly.<br />
Over the last few years years, I've known that all the elements of a
good CPAN-hosted IDE were in place (Wx, Scintilla, PPI) and tried to
encourage someone to build one (because I didn't have the time to lead
it).<br />
By the time Gabor took the initiative and started Padre, I was more
than ready to leave Ultraedit and move to an editor that I actually
have some control over.<br />
The sense of empowerment you get from being able to fix your own editor is the ultimate feature.<br />
 </p><h2>What are you hacking on?</h2>
 <p>I follow behind all
the creative feature-production people doing destructive refactoring
and generally breaking everything. I'm responsible for the&nbsp;
configuration, locale, database, search, and document subsystems.<br />

 I am a full-time Java programmer who enjoys playing with Perl in his 
 free time. I like the creative freedom, challenges and valuable experience 
 that open source projects provide to programmers out there for FREE!
 </p>

<h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
<p>
 I was working on a Perl 6 syntax highlighter when i heard about 
 Gabor's TPF Perl 6 Grant. Naturally, i offered to help out and now i am the 
 co-maintainer of Padre::Plugin::Perl6 with him. My goal is to co-develop a 
 state-of-the-art Perl 6 IDE.
</p>
<h2>What are you hacking on?</h2>
<p>
I am re-writing Syntax::Highlight::Perl6 to provide better PPI-like API. 
Afterwards, we can provide better Perl 6 refactoring support. 
I also wrote Padre::Plugin::Ecliptic to support my ambitious goal of porting 
useful Eclipse features into Padre.

<h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
<p>
Stunned at what had already been achieved with padre 0.2, I felt it deserved
the momentum. I am compelled to make Pod / Doc browser work respectably.
</p>
<h2>What are you hacking on?</h2>
<p>
Padre::DocBrowser and it&apos;s guts the replacement of PodFrame.Lots of differing ways to search and index data, 
<a href="http://marvinhumphrey.com/kinosearch/docs/devel/">KinoSearch</a>
is looking very promising and in perl terms PPI and Pod-Abstract are my new 
best friends. Currently bitbashing and string mashing an index of
 <a href="http://cpants.perl.org/static/cpants_all.db.gz">this</a> just for fun.

<h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
<p>
Because I'm bored with constant quarrels how Perl belongs to the past
and that it don't even have an <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>.
I think supplying the IDE written in Perl itself is appropriate answer
for such accusations.</p>
<p>As for <em>how I got involved</em>, Gabor made me :) He gave me
a commit bit!</p>

<h2>What are you hacking on?</h2>
<p>
I'm writing small pieces of code here and there, like in Run or Find/Replace parts.
Apart from that, I'm maintaining <a href="http://www.freshports.org/editors/p5-Padre/">Padre port for FreeBSD</a>.

<h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
<p>
I started the development of Padre as I wanted to create an editor
for people who don't know Perl yet and for people who use Perl
only as an add-on tool and thus even after several years of usage
are not very familiar with the language, its special cases and CPAN.</p>
<p>
I knew I cannot do that alone so I decided to try to make it interesting 
enough for hard-core Perl developers to give it a try, to use it at
least in some special cases or to manage large projects and to help in 
the development.
</p>
<p>
I also hope Padre can be a springboard to learn Perl 6.
</p>
<p>
I used to use vim and gvim both on 
Linux and Windows but since the first release of Padre I have been
using it almost exclusively.
</p>
<h2>What are you hacking on?</h2>
<p>
Everything a bit but mostly I am trying to get more people involved.

<p>is enjoying programming perl</p>
 <h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
 <p>
i've been long using vi, them emacs, then vi again. i always wanted a
perl ide, designed around perl programming - and not added as an after
thought. padre has a huge potential wrt this expectation. and being
programmed in perl allows me to fix what i dislike in it...
 </p>
 <h2>What are you hacking on?</h2>
 <p>
when i'm working on padre (which happens by bursts), i'm touching a lot
of different parts of the codebase: the plugin manager and the sessions
are my fault, so is the i18n plugin api. i'm fixing stuff that annoy
me, try to sanitize fishy stuff (removing circular dependencies, etc)
and document things that i'm forced to dig into... generally, i'm
checking the bug tracker on a regular basis and try to pick &amp; close
random bugs. i also contributed a few plugins, and maintain padre's
french translation.

<p> doesn't think he's all that interesting. If you must know, he's a physicist who enjoys

<h2>Why are you involved in Padre?</h2>
<p>
I'm the maintainer of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PAR">PAR</a> suite of modules.
Originally, I wanted to use the opportunity of a new application to create a PAR-based
plugin system. Then I had a drink with Gabor at YAPC::EU 2009 in Copenhagen.
That's where it went downhill...</p>
 <p>More seriously, I simply enjoy being able to modify and customize the tools I use
to get work done.</p>
<h2>What are you hacking on?</h2>
<p>
I designed the concurrency system around Padre::Task, put together the PAR support for plugins,
and wrote most of the Perl-specific refactoring support code using Adam's wonderful PPI module.
Adding more "smart" refactoring tools is currently my highest priority.
