The pages of L<http://padre.perlide.org/> are generated by these scripts and
templates.

=head1 Developers page

1) add an ini file in the F<data/developers/> directory

2) add the nickname to the developers: section of F<data/stash.yml>

=head1 Translators page

1) add an ini file in the F<data/translators/> directory

2) add the nickname to the translators: section of F<data/stash.yml>

The idea is that everyone involved (including translators, packagers, testers etc.)
adds themselves to the developers page in English.
The translators page should be written in the respective languages of the
relevant people.

=head1 About page

The list of blog entries is maintained manually in F<data/stash.yml>.
