<h1>How to?</h1>
<p>
The following howto entries are meant to go through step-by-step various tasks 
that can be done with Padre. We plan to extend these and add screenshots to
aid the learning process and later to turn some of them into screencasts.

<h1>Getting Started with Padre on Windows</h1>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Download Padre 0.45 from <a href="download.html">download</a> the name of the file to be saved on 
      the desktop is called padre-standalone-0.45.msi</li>
  <li>Run this installer by double clicking on the icon.</li>
  <li>It will ask you to accept the terms. Once you did that you can press the Install button.</li>
  <li>Once installation is finished you should be able to see the installed icons by pressing 
     on "Start" then on "Programs" and then selecting "Padre Standalone".</li>
  <li>The package you downloaded is the latest version packaged for Windows but there are 
      newer versions of Padre on CPAN. You should now upgrade by doing the following:
      Click on "Start", "Run", copy the following command and press ENTER:
      <br />
    <code>perl -MCPAN -e "CPAN->upgrade('/^Padre/')"</code><br />
    or maybe better with full path to the perl exe:<br />
    <code>c:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe -MCPAN -e "CPAN->upgrade('/^Padre/')"</code><br />
    This will open a black window. You'll see text printed in that 
    window while Padre is being upgraded. The process can take anywhere between 
    4-5 minutes and 70 minutes depending on the speed of your Internet connection 
    and the phase of the Moon.
    </li>
    <li>Run Padre by clicking on "Start", selecting "Programs", 
       selecting "Padre Standalone" and clicking on the "Padre" icon. 
       (there will be two windows, a black console and the editor itself).
       This is considered a bug and it will be fixed in a future version.
    </li>
    <li>Select "Plugins", "Plugin Manager", you should see a list of plugins. 
      Please make sure to enable the "Padre Developer Tools" Plugin and the 
      "Padre Popularity Contest" plugin as well.</li>
    <li>Click on "Save"</li>

<h1>Getting Started with Padre Standalone Plus Six on Windows</h1>
<p>
This is the previous package that is only recommended for people interested in Perl 6.
In the future it will be distrubuted directly from the <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a> web site.
<ol>
  <li>Download Padre 0.41 from <a href="download.html">download</a> the name of the file to be saved on 
      the desktop is called almost-six-0.41.msi</li>
  <li>Run this installer by double clicking on the icon.</li>
  <li>It will ask you to accept the terms. Once you did that you can press the Install button.</li>
  <li>Once installation is finished you should be able to see the installed icons by pressing 
     on "Start" then on "Programs" and then selecting "Padre Standalone Plus Six".</li>
  <li>The package you downloaded is the latest version packaged for Windows but there are

      Click on "Start", "Run", copy the following command and press ENTER:

    <li>Run Padre by clicking on "Start", selecting "Programs",

       (there will be two windows, a black console and the editor itself).
       This is considered a bug and it will be fixed in a future version.
    </li>
    <li>Close the Output window (Uncheck View/Show Output)</li>
    <li>Select "Plugins", "Plugin Manager", you should see a list of plugins. 
      Please make sure at least the the "Perl 6" plugin is enabled but it would 
      be better to enable the "Padre Developer Tools" Plugin and the 
      "Padre Popularity Contest" plugin as well.</li>
    <li>Select "Edit", "Preferences", "Run Parameters" and make sure 
        "Use external window for execution" is checked.</li>
    <li>Click on "Files and Colors" (in older versions it was called "Mime-types").
        Select the Perl 6 as "File type" and select "STD.pm" as Highlighter.</li>
    <li>Click on "Save"</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Help for problem solving:<br />

run "Start", "Run", type in "cmd" and press enter. In the black window type  <code>echo %PATH%</code> then type <code>perl -V</code>
