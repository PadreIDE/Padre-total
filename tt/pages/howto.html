<h1>How to?</h1>
<p>
The following howto entries are meant to go through step-by-step various tasks 
that can be done with Padre. We plan to extend these and add screenshots to
aid the learning process and later to turn some of them into screencasts.

<h1>Getting Started with Padre on Windows</h1>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Download Padre 0.45 from <a href="download.html">download</a> the name of the file to be saved on 
      the desktop is called padre-standalone-0.45.msi</li>
  <li>Run this installer by double clicking on the icon.</li>
  <li>It will ask you to accept the terms. Once you did that you can press the Install button.</li>
  <li>Once installation is finished you should be able to see the installed icons by pressing 
     on "Start" then on "Programs" and then selecting "Padre Standalone".</li>
  <li>The package you downloaded is the latest version packaged for Windows but there are 
      newer versions of Padre on CPAN. You should now upgrade by doing the following:
      Click on "Start", "Run", copy the following command and press ENTER:
      <br />
    <code>perl -MCPAN -e "CPAN->upgrade('/^Padre/')"</code><br />
    or maybe better with full path to the perl exe:<br />
    <code>c:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe -MCPAN -e "CPAN->upgrade('/^Padre/')"</code><br />
    This will open a black window. You'll see text printed in that 
    window while Padre is being upgraded. The process can take anywhere between 
    4-5 minutes and 70 minutes depending on the speed of your Internet connection 
    and the phase of the Moon.
    </li>
    <li>Run Padre by clicking on "Start", selecting "Programs", 
       selecting "Padre Standalone" and clicking on the "Padre" icon. 
       (there will be two windows, a black console and the editor itself).
       This is considered a bug and it will be fixed in a future version.
    </li>
    <li>Select "Plugins", "Plugin Manager", you should see a list of plugins. 
      Please make sure to enable the "Padre Developer Tools" Plugin and the 
      "Padre Popularity Contest" plugin as well.</li>

This is the previous package that is only recommended for people interested in Perl 6.

    <li>Close the Output window (Uncheck View/Show Output)</li>
    <li>Select "Plugins", "Plugin Manager", you should see a list of plugins. 
      Please make sure at least the the "Perl 6" plugin is enabled but it would 
      be better to enable the "Padre Developer Tools" Plugin and the 
      "Padre Popularity Contest" plugin as well.</li>
    <li>Select "Edit", "Preferences", "Run Parameters" and make sure 
        "Use external window for execution" is checked.</li>
    <li>Click on "Files and Colors" (in older versions it was called "Mime-types").
        Select the Perl 6 as "File type" and select "STD.pm" as Highlighter.</li>

<div style="float: top;">
[% WRAPPER chrome/styled_panel %]
<h1>Using Help</h1>
<p>
Padre really wants to help you, as such there is no single set of help documentation for now.
</p>
<p>
Key bindings for F1 will bring up the Docbrowser a means to search for and browse Perldoc, F2 searches the core language documentation, such as built in functions ( split, join ), variables and core Modules. 
</p>
<h2>Using the Docbrowser</h2>
<p>
Perl comes with a wealth of documentation, perldoc is allows the programmer access to documentation on a given module:
<pre>
pete@eeeyore~ $ perldoc Net::LDAP

NAME
       Net::LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::LDAP;

        $ldap = Net::LDAP->new( 'ldap.bigfoot.com' ) or die "$@";


</pre> 
or when used with the -f switch, documentation on built-in functions:
<pre>
pete@eeeyore~ $ perldoc -f split
       split /PATTERN/,EXPR,LIMIT
       split /PATTERN/,EXPR
       split /PATTERN/
       split   Splits the string EXPR into a list of strings and returns that list.  By default, empty leading fields are
               preserved, and empty trailing ones are deleted.  (If all fields are empty, they are considered to be
               trailing.)
...
</pre>
</p>
<p>
However having an open console to alt-tab to typing perldoc "Module::Name" or perldoc -f "function" gets tedious quickly.
</p>
<p>
You can do this in Padre itself.
</p>
<h3>Using F1 to access perldoc for Installed Modules</h3>
<p>
The current keybinding <b>F1</b> will bring up the "docbrowser":
<br>
<img src="./static/howto/padre-f1-initial.png"/>
<br>
Here you can see the initial Help opens and presents you with the perldoc from Padre.pm.
</p>
<p>
The docbrowser is your way of searching for and browsing the perldoc-umentation for any installed Perl Modules that contain POD.
</p>
<p>
Now it's time to search for information about the document we are currently interested in using.  In this case Net::LDAP.
<br>
<img src="./static/howto/padre-f1-search.png"/>
<br>
</p>
<p>
The docbrowser will create href links to documentation referenced and linked to within any perldoc.
<br>
<img src="./static/howto/padre-f1-links.png"/>
<br>
</p>
<p>
In this case IO::Socket is referenced and a link has been created, clicking on the link will open a new tab with the IO::Socket POD.
<br>
<img src="./static/howto/padre-f1-link-clicked.png"/>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Using F2 for Perl documentation</h2>
<p>
To search for help on built in funtions, such as split or join, global variables, such as $$ or $/, 
or any of the core Modules, the key binding for the Help Search dialog is <b>F2</b>.
<br>
<img src="./static/howto/padre-f2-initial.png"/>
<br>
</p>
<p>
With the dialog box now open, you can type in terms to search for:
<br>
<img src="./static/howto/padre-f2-search.png"/>
<br>
</p>
<p>
This help search is better integrated into Padre, highlight a word or module name ( such as warnings ) and hit F2, Help will 
show you the documenation related to the item high lighted in the main Padre document window.
<br>
<img src="./static/howto/padre-f2-context.png"/>
