<h1>Free Support</h1>
<p>
Padre is an open source project and such you can get high quality free support
from many volunteers. Of course as they offer they help on a volunteer basis
and free of charge you cannot make requirements of help. When approaching any of
the support channels, please do it in a humble way.
</p>
<p>
As Padre is an open source project there is no artificial separation between
tier-1, tier-2, tier-3 etc support. When you ask a question on one of the
public and free support channels you will get answers from fellow users of
Padre or straight from the developers.

<h2>IRC channel</h2>
<p>
The primary support channel is the IRC channel of the Padre developers. It is located
on the irc.perl.org server and it is called #padre. You can use either an IRC client
if you have one on your computer or the web-based Mibbit IRC client. For the formers
you would want to click on <a href="irc://irc.perl.org/#padre">this link</a>. If you prefer
to use the web based client the you can follow the link to the
<a href="http://widget.mibbit.com/?server=irc.perl.org&amp;channel=%23padre">web based IRC client to #padre</a>.
After clicking on that link you will be prompted to give a nickname. The field is filled by
a random name that you can leave as it is though it is probably better to select
a nickname that fits your personalty.
</p>
<p>
After clicking on the <i>Connect</i> button you will see the #padre IRC channel. First it will
print some welcome information that you can usually disregard and then you will be able to say
hi by just typing it and pressing enter. Then you can proceed to ask your question.
</p>
<p>
After asking a question please be patient as the people might be busy doing other
things so it can take some time till someone responds.

<h2>Mailing list</h2>
<p>
The Padre development mailing list is another way to ask for help.
It is usually slower than IRC but it also means you don't have to
be connected to the channel while waiting someone to answer your
questions. To join the mailing list please visit the registration page
of the <a href="http://mail.perlide.org/mailman/listinfo/padre-dev">padre-dev</a>
mailing list.
