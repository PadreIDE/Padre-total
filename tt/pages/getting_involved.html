<h2>Getting Involved - How can I participate?</h2>
<p>
We encourage participation of all kinds.
</p>
<p>
There's tons of simple things you can do even if you don't have much time!
<p>

<p>
As we are using Trac for bug tracking and project management many of the links in this
section lead to the relevant page on our <a href="/trac/">trac</a> installation.
<ul>
 <li><a href="contact.html">Talk to us</a> via our IRC channel or our mailing list!</li>
 <li>Try out the latest release and tell us what you think. 
     The first step is to <a href="download.html">download</a> and install Padre.
     It is very easy on MS Windows, it is slightly more difficult on Linux or Mac OSX 
     but we are working on that too. <a href="/trac/wiki/Distribution">Packaging and distribution</a>
     is one of the areas where we'll be glad to get your help.
 </li>
 <li>Turn on the <b>Padre Popularity Contest</b> Plugin so we can study how you use Padre. 
    (Once Padre is installed go to the Plugins menu option. Select the "Plugin Manager"
    Select the "Padre Popularity Contest" and click on the "Enable" button.
