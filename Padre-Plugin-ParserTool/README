Padre-Plugin-ParserTool

The ParserTool plugin adds an interactive parser testing tool for Padre.

It provides a two-panel dialog where you can type file contents into a panel
on one side, and see a realtime dump of the resulting parsed structure on the
other side of the dialog.

The dialog is configurable, so it can be used to test both common Perl parsers
and parsers for custom file formats of your own.
