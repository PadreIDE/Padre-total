=head1 NAME

Padre::Wx::Main - The main window for the Padre IDE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Padre::Wx::Main> implements Padre's main window. It is the window
containing the menus, the notebook with all opened tabs, the various
sub-windows (outline, subs, output, errors, etc).

It inherits from C<Wx::Frame>, so check Wx documentation to see all
the available methods that can be applied to it besides the added ones
(see below).

=head2 Constructor

There's only one constructor for this class.

=head3 C<new>

    my $main = Padre::Wx::Main->new($ide);

Create and return a new Padre main window. One should pass a C<Padre>
object as argument, to get a reference to the Padre application.

# NOTE: Yes this method does get a little large, but that's fine.
#       It's better to have one bigger method that is easily
#       understandable rather than scattering tightly-related code
#       all over the file in unrelated places.
#       If you feel the need to make this smaller, try to make each
#       individual step tighter and better abstracted.
