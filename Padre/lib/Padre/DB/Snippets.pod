The C<select> method executes a typical SQL C<SELECT> query on the
snippets table.

It takes an optional argument of a SQL phrase to be added after the
C<FROM snippets> section of the query, followed by variables
to be used for any placeholders in the conditions. Any SQL that is
compatible with SQLite can be used in the parameter.

Returns a list of B<Padre::DB::Snippets> objects when called in list context, or a
reference to an ARRAY of B<Padre::DB::Snippets> objects when called in scalar context.

Throws an exception on error, typically directly from the L<DBI> layer.

=head1 SUPPORT

Padre::DB::Snippets is part of the L<Padre::DB> API.

See the documentation for L<Padre::DB> for more information.
