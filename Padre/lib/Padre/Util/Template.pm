=head1 NAME

Padre::Util - Padre utility functions for new-file-templates

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Padre::Util::Template> package contains helper functions for templates
used to create new files. They should be backward-compatible all the time as
they might be used by user-created templates not living on the Padre storage.

We're using Template::Tiny which is unable to pass arguments to method calls,
so we need to have one method per case.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=cut

use 5.008;
use strict;
use warnings;

our $VERSION = '0.65';

# This is a Padre::Util module where the subs should be called as functions,
# but Template::Tiny requires us to use a blessed package and we could use
# the object as a cache.
sub new {
	my $class = shift;

	my $self = bless {}, $class;

	return $self;
}


=pod

=head2 C<new_modulename>

Asks for the name of a new module which is returned.

Return the user replied value on subsequent calls.

=cut

sub new_modulename {
	my $self = shift;

	$self->{_modulename} ||= Padre->ide->wx->main->prompt( Wx::gettext('New module'), Wx::gettext('Module name:') )
		|| 'New::Module';

	return $self->{_modulename};
}
