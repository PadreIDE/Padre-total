=head1 NAME

Padre::Plugin::PopularityContest - The Padre Popularity Contest

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Padre Popularity Contest is a plugin that collects various information
about your Padre installation as it runs, and reports that information
over the internet to a central server.

The information collected from the Popularity Contest Plugin is used by the
development team to track the adoption rate of different features, to help
set the default configuration values, and to prioritise development focus.

In otherwords, to make life better for you in the next release, and the
ones after that.

=head2 What information will we collect?

Right now? Nothing. It does nothing, and it collects nothing whatsoever.

It is merely a stub to store your permission to allow us to collect 
information later.

We're not B<exactly> sure what we'll need yet, and the plan is to
gradually add hooks one at a time as needed.

=head2 What information WON'T we collect?

There are some things we can be B<very> clear about.

1. We will B<NEVER> begin to collect information of any kind without
you first explicitly telling us we are allowed to collect that type
of information.

2. We will B<NEVER> do any information that would result in
a copyright violation. That means we won't collect, record, or
transmit the contents of any file.

3. We will B<NEVER> transmit the name of any file, or the cryptographic
hash of any file, or any other unique identifier of any file, although we
may need to record them locally as index keys or for optimisation purposes.

3. We will B<NEVER> transmit any information that relates to you
personally unless you have given it to us already (in which case we'll
only send an account identifier, not the details themselves).

4. We will B<NEVER> transmit any information about your operating system,
or any information about your network that could possibly compromise
security in any way.

5. We will take as much care as we can to ensure that the collection,
analysis, compression and/or transmission of your information consumes
as little resources as possible, and we will in particular attempt to
minimize the resource impact while you are actively coding.

Finally, if you really don't trust us (or you aren't allowed to trust us
because you work inside a secure network) then we encourage you to delete
this plugin entirely.
