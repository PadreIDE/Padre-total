=head1 NAME

Padre::Service - persistent Padre::Task API

=head2 SYNOPSIS

  # Create your service, default implementation warns to output
  #  sleeps 1 second and loops over.
  my $service = Padre::Service->new();
  Wx::Event::EVT_COMMAND(
	$main , -1 , $service->event ,
	\&receive_data_from_service
  );
  $service->schedule;
  $service->
  
  
  # Later
  $service->shutdown; # Your show_my_dialog will be called...,eventually

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Padre::Service extends L<Padre::Task> to provide a means to launch and 
control a long running background service, without blocking the editor.

=head2 EXTENDING

To extend this class, inherit it and implement C<service_loop> and preferabbly
C<hangup>

C<service_loop> should not block forever. If there is no work for the service to do
then return immediately, allowing the C<<Task->run>> loop to continue.

  package Padre::Service::HTTPD
  use base qw( Padre::Service );
  
  sub prepare { # Build a dummy httpd.conf from $self , "BREAK" if error }
  
  sub service_start { # Launch httpd binary goodness, IPC::Run3 maybe? }
  
  sub service_shutdown { # Clean shutdown httpd binary }
  
  sub service_loop { # ->select($timeout) on your IPC handles }
  
  sub hangup { ->service_shutdown ?!?}
  
  sub terminate { # Stop everything, brutally }
  
=head1 METHODS

=head2 run

Overrides C<Padre::Task::run> providing a non-blocking loop around the
TaskManager to Service shared queue.
C<run> will call ->hangup or ->terminate on your service if instructed
by the main thread, otherwise C<service_loop> is called in void context
with no arguments B<IN A TIGHT LOOP>.

=head2 start

consider start the background_thread analog of C<prepare> and will be called
in the service thread immediatly prior to the service loop starting.


=cut

=head2 hangup

Called on your service when the editor requests a hangup. Your service is obliged
to gracefully stop what it is doing and return from this method as soon as possible

=cut

sub hangup {
	my ( $self, $running ) = @_;
	$$running = 0;
}

=head2 terminate

Called on your service when TaskManager believes your service is hung or not
responding to a C<<->hangup>. Your service is obliged to B<IMMEDIATELY> stop
everything and to hell with the consequences. 

=cut

sub terminate {
	my ( $self, $running ) = @_;
	$$running = 0;
}

=head2 service_loop

Called in a loop while the service is believed to be running
The default implementation emits output to the editor and sleeps for a
second before returning control to the loop.

=cut

{

	sub service_loop {
		my ( $self, $incoming ) = @_;
		$self->{iterator} = 0
			unless exists $self->{iterator};
		my $tid = threads->tid;
		$self->task_print('ok - entered service loop')
			|| print "ok - entered service loop\n";

		if ( defined $incoming ) {
			$self->task_print("ok - got incoming service data '$incoming'");
		}

		# Tell the main thread some progress.
		$self->post_event( $self->event, "$self->{iterator}" );

		$self->{iterator}++;
		$self->tell('HANGUP') if $self->{iterator} > 10;
		sleep 1;
	}
}

=head2 event

Accessor for this service's instance event, in the running service
data may be posted to this event and the Wx subscribers will be notified
 
=cut

	sub event {

	}

=head2 queue

accessor for the shared queue the service thread is polling for input.
Calling C<enqueue> on reference sends data to the service thread. Storable
serialization rules apply. See also L<"event"> for receiving data from 
the service thread
 
=cut

		# the event
		my $service_event : shared = Wx::NewEventType;
		$ServiceEvents{$service_refid} = $service_event;

	$queue->enqueue('HANGUP');
}

sub cleanup {
	my $self = shift;
	Padre::Util::debug("cleanup - $self");
}

=head2 tell

Accepts a reference as it's argument, this is serialized and sent to
the service thread

=cut  

## MAIN
sub tell {
	my ( $self, $ref ) = @_;
	my $queue = $self->queue;
	$queue->enqueue($ref);
