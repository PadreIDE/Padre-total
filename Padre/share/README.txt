Note to Packagers:

This directory contains general padre-specific imagery, all of which have
either been created from scratch by members of the Padre team as described
below (they fall under the same terms as Perl(!) itself) or have their
source individually documented and verified with licensing information
below.

Note to Developers:

Make damn sure it stays that way!
