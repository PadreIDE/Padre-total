README for padre.exe

This is Padre's win32 launcher. It does the following:
	* Tries to find the padre script in the same directory as padre.exe
          If it fails, it exits with a message box.
	* Tries to find wperl.exe in the executable path.
	  If it succeed, it will set $^X to this path.
	* Creates a Perl interpreter and run the padre script.

Padre.exe is dynamically linked to the perl<xxx>.dll on which it was built, so
it is safer to build it at install time on a user machine.

To compile it, simply 'perl Makefile.PL' or 'cpan .' in the parent folder.
You'll of course need Strawberry Perl as it has gcc and windres out of the box.
