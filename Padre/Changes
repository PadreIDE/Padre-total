Changes for Perl Application Development and Refactoring Environment
NOTE: Do not "tidy" or change the indenting here, or we break svn annotate

0.69 2010.08.17
    - Landed ConfigSync branch (MATTP)
    - Task 2.0 restores support for having tasks send unlimited messages
      back to the main application while they are running (ADAMK)
    - Added Padre::Task::Run for background process execution with STDOUT
      lines streaming as events back to the main window. (ADAMK)
    - Fixed test failure in t/93-padre-filename-win.t under win32 (SEWI)
    - Devel plugin now has the option to dump the Task Manager (GARU)
    - Refactored, reskinned and polished ConfigSync functionality (ADAMK)
    - Added ->status to ::Main to allow rapid transient messages to be
      presented in the status bar, as fast as 100/sec (ADAMK)
    - Fixed the file-changed-on-disk dialog: Show "Reload" button instead
      of "Close" (SEWI)
    - Adding a ton of additional $BACKCOMPATIBLE variables so that every
      class consumed by the current family of plugins has them (ADAMK)
    - Nudging up the default background thread count now that we will
      start to see long-running threads looking after background
      processes (ADAMK)
    - Allow the opening of files exceeding the editor_file_size_limit of
      500_000. The file is opened if the user answers Yes to the
      dialog (MULANDER)
    - The Task Manager now records per-worker statistics on which tasks they
      have run in the past. This is needed to support various worker
      optimisation strategies to be implemented in the future (ADAMK)
    - Added a simple initial Task Manager optimisation strategy to favour
      workers which have run a task at least once before (ADAMK)
    - "Find method declaration" will not find forward-declaration (CHORNY)
    - Task manager now has separate maximum and minimum thread counts (ADAMK)
    - Minimum thread count set to zero. Padre starts up 600ms faster, at the
      cost of the directory tree appearing 200ms slower if you use it (ADAMK)
    - Command line switch to select locale (CHORNY)
    - Added configuration option to modify the cursor blink rate in Padre
      as requested via the padre-dev mailing list closes ticket number
      983 (PLAVEN)
    - Added Padre::Task::Daemon for bidirectional communication support in
      tasks. When the task is launched, messages to the chlid can be sent
      down the worker thread's message queue, and they will be tunneled
      through to the task, which can retrieve them Erlang-style via a
      dequeue method (ADAMK)

0.68 2010.07.28 - Unstable - Post Birthday Hackathon Weekend
    - Fixed rare bug in t/23_task_chain.t (CHORNY)
    - Refactored the Action subsystem into a simpler model. The old layout
      artificially broke it up based on menu structure. The new layout
      also makes it simpler to do further refactorings (ADAMK)
    - Removed half the usages of Wx::Perl::Dialog (ADAMK)
    - Use a hyphen to a separate the current vs native names of the languages
      in the View menu, as the bracing looked weird with the bracing of some
      of the languages themselves (ADAMK, ZENOG)
    - Don't show a additional translated string for the language that is
      currently active (ADAMK, ZENOG)
    - When the advanced setting "feature_fontsize" is disabled, Padre will
      remove the Font Size menu, disable Ctrl-+ and Ctrl--, and (most
      importantly) will not change the font size in an editor on
      Ctrl-Scroll (ADAMK)
    - Added integration with the PPI::Transform API for modifying Perl
      documents, so the transform objects can modify Padre documents (ADAMK)
    - Added the "Move POD to __END__" refactoring that lets you extract all
      the POD scattered through a document, merge it together, and move it
      to the bottom of the file after an __END__ statement (ADAMK)
    - If the Open Selection expression only matches one file, immediately
      open it without showing a pointless dialog (ADAMK)
    - Removed Wx::Perl::Dialog by inlining it into Padre::Wx::Dialog, this
      will remove the need to import ':everything', saving 50-100k (ADAMK)
    - Actions now only need to be declared once, and are all declared in one
      place in advance (ADAMK)
    - Directory Tree sort order is now (advanced) configurable between
      directory-first and directory-mixed (ADAMK)
    - Moved the Padre::Action* classes to Padre::Wx::Action* as they are now
      much more tightly dependant on Wx (ADAMK)
    - Plugins will now do full compatibility testing, which means that when we
      change an internal API we can just update $COMPATIBLE in that package
      and any impacted plugins will be automatically disabled until they do a
      new release. That is far better than "They just crash blindly" (ADAMK)
    - Create a new main_directory_root settting distinct from the existing
      default_projects_directory one, specifically for setting the default
      root of the directory tree. It will continue to be pointed to
      my_documents by default (the original may change) (ADAMK)
    - Made Padre::Wx::Dialog::ModuleStart configuration translation-safe (ZENOG)
    - Updated German translation (ZENOG)
    - Add Java and BibTeX to MIME types (ZENOG)
    - Ack ("find in files") output is now more 'clickable', but still not
      perfect (ZENOG)
    - Fix File::Open3::open3() call to be IPC::Open3::open3() (BRICAS)
    - Fix #969: crash when switching language after using Ack (ZENOG)
    - Remove unnecessary Wx::gettext calls from Padre::Wx::Dialog::Preferences
      that lead to missing translations (ZENOG)
    - Description field is hidden by default in the regex editor dialog.
      A checkbox now optionally toggles its visibility (AZAWAWI)
    - Padre::Wx::FindResult: Get rid of global variable, shorter column
      titles, both columns now wxLIST_AUTOSIZE (ZENOG)
    - Call relocale() for all elements of the Bottom panel (ZENOG)
    - Remember sorting order in session manager (SEWI) 
    - Nicer workflow for renaming variables: Now we check for some conditions
      before prompting the user for a name; renamed function
      'lexical_variable_replacement' to 'rename_variable' (ZENOG)
    - Simplify the code for the Bottom pane a bit (-1 method), no warnings
      any more (ZENOG)
    - Fixed #970: Switching language removes plugin menus (ZENOG)
    - Padre::MimeTypes: Fixed some Wx::gettext handling problems, switched
      keys of menu_view_mimes() so that the names (not the MIME types) of
      file types are shown in the View menu (ZENOG)
    - Documentation of Padre::Current (SEWI)
    - Include only changed files in changed-file-list (SEWI)
    - Added wxwidgets.pod which contains the method documentation of all Wx
      classes (AZAWAWI)
    - Padre has wxWidgets method documentation in F2 help search (AZAWAWI)
    - Added Padre::Wx::Nth to group first/nth-time startup magic (ADAMK)
    - Fixed #781 : Unicode should not be used for accessing file system on
      Win32 (CHORNY)
    - The New Installation Survey now only appears on the third time that
      Padre starts, so it doesn't confuse people with locale issues (ADAMK)
    - Split Padre::Wx::Dialog::WhereFrom into main and FBP classes to try
      out the designer-based approach experimentally (ADAMK)
    - Tab width is configurable for opened file too (CHORNY)

0.67 2010.07.27
    - 0.67 never made it to public release.  All changes listed for 0.68 are what 0.67
      would have had.

0.66 2010.07.01
    - Improved the quality and integration of the default window size (ADAMK)
    - The non-blocking IO upgrade in 0.65 meant that Padre could no longer
      open files on Windows. Fixed (ADAMK)
    - Minor improvements to the About dialog (ADAMK)

0.65 2010.07.01
    - Task 2.0 API landed on trunk (and everything breaks) (ADAMK)
    - Converted the FunctionList GUI component to work via a task (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Role::Task role added to allow any object in Padre
      to be the "owner" of task and automatically handle which
      tasks are still relevant to the UI state at the time the task
      is completed, and ignore the ones that aren't (ADAMK)
    - New compulsory Padre::Wx::Role::View for editor GUI componants
      that want to live in the left/right/bottom tool panels (ADAMK)
    - Renamed a number of classes to simpler names. Because we are
      breaking everything anyway, this is an opportune time to lump
      in these low-importance changes (ADAMK)
    - Padre::DocBrowser --> Padre::Browser (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Wx::DocBrowser --> Padre::Wx::Browser (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Wx::Role::MainChild --> Padre::Wx::Role::Main (ADAMK)
    - Language-specific task sub-classes now live under the document class
      instead of under the Padre::Task tree, to encourage concentration
      of language-specific code within the document tree (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Task::Perl::Syntax --> Padre::Document::Perl::Syntax (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Task::Perl::Outline --> Padre::Document::Perl::Outline (ADAMK)
    - Startup config file now uses a custom hyper-minimalist format
      which avoids the need to load YAML::Tiny before the first thread
      spawn, saving about 400k per thread (ADAMK)
    - Padre::Logger now allows the PADRE_DEBUG environment variable to be
      set to a specific class name, enabling logging only for that class.
      This simplies tracing around a specific problem now that the number
      of classes with debugging hooks is getting large (ADAMK)
    - Moved the startup tool enabling of the syntax check and error list
      from the startup timer to the constructor, and prevent them from
      writing back to the config. We no longer need to write the config
      at all during startup, making startup faster (ADAMK)
    - Scroll the output window down on outputs (kthakore)
    - Directory browser rewritten to operate in the background (ADAMK)
    - Improved directory tree search to take advantage of new background
      file scanning. It is now instantaneously quick (ADAMK)
    - Added the PPI::Cache API to provide a simple common mechanism for
      stashing GUI model data such that all cache data can be cleaned up in
      one go when the relevant project or document is released (ADAMK)
    - Fixing some new bugs or adding temporary workarounds for them (SEWI)
    - Rebuild History using non-blocking IO on Padre start (SEWI)

0.64 2010.06.12
    - Last Stable before merge of new Task 2.0 API
    - zh-cn translation updated (jagd)

0.63 2010.06.02
    - Autocomplete "sub new" for Perl modules (SEWI)
    - fixed ticket #956: crashes if Outline is active (ZENOG)

0.62 2010.05.21
    - Any 3 column table layout in the preferences dialog now has a 
      stretched middle column. (PLAVEN)
    - Add a warning for versions of Wx.pm with broken HTML rendering
      (ZENOG)
    - Mousing over a sub/method name with ctrl pressed now highlights it
      to indicate it can be clicked on (Sam Crawley) 
    - Regex editor: Support global flag for substitute (ZENOG)
    - Updated Turkish translation (Burak Gürsoy)
 
0.61 2010.05.12
    - MIME types: added a few C++ file extensions, added LaTeX .sty files
      (Zeno Gantner)
    - About dialog: increase height of the window so that the translated
      licensing terms also fit in without a scrollbar (Zeno Gantner)
    - Debugger: improved variable detection in the document (Zeno Gantner)
    - Menu: More consistent capitalization of menu entries (Zeno Gantner)
    - Updated German translation (Zeno Gantner)
    - fixed ticket #538: "outline view info takes too long to refresh" by
      adding an outline cache (Zeno Gantner)
    - fixed ticket #541: "wrong outline can get displayed for a document"
      (Zeno Gantner)
    - fixed ticket #940: "crashes when right clicking in code editing area"
      (Zeno Gantner)
    - fixed ticket #878: "Tabs like 'Outline', 'Functions'... should have
      a close button, just like the documents tabs" (Zeno Gantner)
    - fixed behaviour of the close button for the bottom tabs (Output,
      Errors, Syntax Check): closing a tab now toggles the corresponding
      menu and config items (Zeno Gantner)
    - Updated German translation (Zeno Gantner)
    - Updated Chinese translation (Chuanren Wu)
    - fixed ticket #939: "Padre 'help' depends on POD2-Base on Strawberry
      Perl on Windows XP" (ADAMK)
    - Updated Italian translation (SBLANDIN)
    - Updated Brazilian Portuguese translation (GARU)
    - Updated Dutch translation (Dirk De Nijs)
    - Updated Spanish translation (ENELL)

0.60 2010.04.20
    - Add FTP connection caching/sharing (SEWI)
    - Add interactive template functions (SEWI)
    - Fixed ticket #900: opening binary files may crash Padre (Zeno Gantner)
    - Improved some menu entries: added missing "...", better labels, better
      comments (Zeno Gantner)
    - Clearer error message if debugger is not started yet (Zeno Gantner)
    - Complete language/locale switch on Unix platforms: also correctly
      translate the Wx default labels (Zeno Gantner)
    - Fixed ticket #921: regex syntax error in Regex Editor
      (reported by leprevost)
    - Updated German and Turkish translation (Zeno Gantner, SEWI and Burak
      Gürsoy)
    - Added licensing information to About dialog (Zeno Gantner)
    - Skip '.' when indexing installed modules in @INC (dam)
    - Fixed bug related to search history (Sam Crawley)
    - Added file type filter "script file" (which includes Unix shell scripts
      and Windows .bat files) to the Open dialog (Zeno Gantner)
    - MIME types: added .mo to the list of binary file extensions, 
      improved/gettext-ified some descriptions, changed LaTeX extension from
      latex to tex (Zeno Gantner)
    - Autocomplete no longer displays the dialog when only one option is
      available (unless 'Autocomplete while typing' is on) (Sam Crawley - #927)

0.59 2010.03.31 
    - Don't crash open file list dialog on unsaved files or without
      files (SEWI)
    - Added a small survey for new Padre installation (SEWI)
    - Resolved the clash between threads and SQLite by temporarily
      disconnecting from SQLite during a thread spawn (ADAMK)
    - Slave master quick-spawning in Padre::Startup, so that
      we get smaller thread spawn memory penalty from the
      interpreter copy. On Win32 the per-thread cost drops from
      34.1meg to 20meg with a reduction in total memory use for a
      typical user of about 20% (ADAMK)
    - Add language names/translated texts to select_language list (SEWI)
    - Fixed ticket #865 Wrong document type in View Document As (PLAVEN)
    - New Padre::Wx::Display screen geometry library for handling multiple
      screens, weird geometry setups and other weird stuff that coders
      have on their development setups. Padre's main window uses this to
      calculate an elegant golden-ratio uniform-margin default position
      and size (ADAMK)
    - When showing a toolbar panel for the first time, make sure it's lock
      state is consistent with the main_lockinterface config setting (ADAMK)
    - Local file and remote file installation switched from pip to
      cpanm (ADAMK)
    - Completed the 'Insert Special Value' functionality (Zeno Gantner)
    - Updated German translation (Zeno Gantner)
    - When refresh_windowlist was sped up, sorting regressed. Fixed (ADAMK)
    - Fixed ticket #889: Padre saves non-ASCII characters as \x{XXXX} (AZAWAWI)
    - New Win32 launcher #677: the Padre process is now named "padre.exe"
      in the Task Manager (instead of wperl.exe) and it embeds the Perl
      interpreter instead of being just a launcher (DOLMEN)
    - On Win32 the manifest file (which tells Windows to use new Vista/7
      styles on such systems) is now embedded as a resource in the binary, so
      any wperl.exe.manifest containing the string 'name="Padre"' is obsolete
      and must be removed (DOLMEN)
    - Fixed ticket #904: Win32 taskbar icon is only 16x16 (Windows 7 may uses
      48x48) (AZAWAWI)
    - Small improvements/fixes to some dialogs: Refactoring, Open URL, Goto,
      Save as, Preferences, Insert File, New Perl Distribution (Zeno Gantner)
    - New document statistics dialog, faster computation of document statistics
      (Zeno Gantner)
    - Added missing File::pushd Padre dependency (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed ticket #894: search for non-ASCII characters (Zeno Gantner)

0.58 2010.03.08  **WARNING Still not stable**
    - Fixed "Open File In Existing Padre" for non-win32 (PDONELAN)
    - In advanced preferences, display the storage backend name when it is
      default and 'User' is now called 'Overriden' (AZAWAWI)
    - In advanced preferences, display preferences options for non-boolean
      settings (AZAWAWI) 
    - In advanced preferences, display a True/False radio button for boolean
      settings (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed an incorrect default value display bug in advanced preferences
      when it is toggled (AZAWAWI)
    - In advanced preferences, hide bottom controls at startup (AZAWAWI)
    - In advanced preferences, Set button is hidden when it is a boolean. 
      True/false radio buttons handle the switch instead (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed ticket #858 Recent files does not display anything on Padre startup
      (AZAWAWI)
    - Refresh all menus at startup. This prevents "nothing" open mode (i.e. no
      document) from incorrectly showing an enabled menubar (AZAWAWI)
    - Padre::Util::share() can now get the name of a plugin (e.g. 'Perl6') and
      return the share directory of that plugin (SZABGAB)
    - Removed the unused concept of user-configurable menus, which was slowing
      down a ton of different operations that needed a menu refresh (ADAMK)
    - Removed ->refresh calls during the initial menu construction, as we
      will be refresh'ing again anyway at the end of the startup, and thus
      any work done in the menus is completely wasted CPU (ADAMK)
    - Removed the very expensive window list refresh code from the main menu
      refresh method into it's own dedicated refresh method. We can fire
      this directly in the limited number of situations that the notebook
      adds, removed, or renamed documents (ADAMK)
    - Speed up status bar updates (ADAMK, SEWI)
    - Warning editor markers are now actually orange on win32 (AZAWAWI)
    - Landed new and much much faster refresh_windowlist (ADAMK)
    - Fixed ticket #860: Configurable key bindings dialog (AZAWAWI)
    - Added Browse Buttons to External Tools Preference Dialog (PLAVEN)
    - Fixed ticket #863: Continous warnings or prints kill Padre
      (AZAWAWI, KTHAKORE)
    - Bumped Wx::Perl::ProcessStream version requirement to 0.25 (AZAWAWI)
    - Added promised PPI lexer configurable max-length limit for azawawi (ADAMK)
    - Fixed ticket #867: Padre dies when hitting Ctrl-. (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed ticket #807: F2 is broken (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed ticket #835: Function list not populated on initial panel showing
      (karl.forner)
    - Added Turkish translation.

0.57 2010.02.18 - **WARNING Contains new threading code**
    - Spawn a master thread very early in the startup process. Use that
      master to create worker threads as necessary. Cuts down on memory
      usage and fixes the "Leaked Scalars" warning (BRAMBLE, SMUELLER)
    - Fix pluginmanager error dialog for plugin-event failure (BRAMBLE)
    - Add status messages for Padre::File operations (SEWI)
    - Select some files to close (SEWI)
    - Select some files to reload (SEWI)
    - GotoLine is now called Goto dialog (AZAWAWI)
    - Goto dialog is now non-modal lazy single instance dialog (AZAWAWI)
    - Goto dialog has a current positon/line number field (AZAWAWI)
    - Regex editor dialog is now more compact and it includes regex helper
      buttons (AZAWAWI)
    - Regex editor dialog can now highlight matched text (AZAWAWI)
    - Regex editor dialog can now display regex description (AZAWAWI)
    - Implemented Replace (aka substitution) in Regex editor (AZAWAWI)
    - Right click "Edit with Regex Editor" now works on user-selected
      text (AZAWAWI)
    - Added "headline" method to Padre::Project, which allows a project
      to try and intuit the "primary" file in the project (for a CPAN
      distribution of Foo::Bar this will be lib/Foo/Bar.pm) (ADAMK)
    - Removed the final usage of the "Provider" phrasing, and made more
      of the modules used by the Perl help provider run-time loaded (ADAMK)
    - Moved padre.exe build from bin to win32-loader folder since bin is a
      bad path for putting the Padre win32 launcher code (SMUELLER, AZAWAWI)
    - Added "Open in File Browser" in the File and right-click menu (AZAWAWI)
    - Added "Find in Files" to right-click menu (AZAWAWI)
    - No need to launch a command shell to execute explorer.exe on
      win32 (AZAWAWI)
    - Added "Open with Default System Editor" in "File -> Open..." (AZAWAWI)
    - Implemented padre --reset to flush and reset the current Padre
      configuration in otherwise unrecoverable situations, such as now
      when the Swarm plugin causes the slave-driver code to instantly
      segfault at startup (ADAMK)
    - Add mimetype detection for Template::Toolkit and CSS files (SEWI)
    - Added plugin menu refreshing to the resource locking system (ADAMK)
    - Fixed three cases where code was still manually calling ->Freeze
      and ->Thaw on the main window, breaking the resource locked (ADAMK)
    - Fixed ticket #847: "Implement Mozilla-style about:config for Padre"
      (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed ticket #845: Fix relative filenames from commandline (SEWI)
    - Added "Open In Command Line" to File menu (AZAWAWI)
    - Renamed Plugins menus to Tools and moved Preferences into it (ADAMK)
    - Re-implemented the mechanism for generating a human-oriented list of
      window names (ADAMK)

0.56 2010.02.01
    - Plugins may now add their GUI elements to the view menu (SEWI)
    - Padre now displays a dynamic to-do list generated from comments
      in your source code (CORION)
    - Landed new Padre::Startup module which is dramatically faster
      when loading files into an existing Padre via the single instance
      server, and finally provides a mechanism for allowing configuration
      to disable the startup splash image (ADAMK)
    - Changed a few configuration settings to create a more consistent
      naming pattern for them (ADAMK)
    - Audited dependencies and updated a variety of them (ADAMK)
    - Ctrl-Shift-W is now bound to "Close This Project" (ADAMK)
    - Added an option for traceing Padre subroutine calls to the
      developer plugin (SEWI)
    - Uses correct make from Config.pm for the run menu item -> Build and
      run tests (KTHAKORE)
    - Speedup and less false-shows for autocomplete (SEWI)
    - Speedup while changing tabs (use the correct project dir) (SEWI)
    - Simple refocus on document after command run (KTHAKORE)
    - Fixed ticket #822: main window could be off screen on start (BLAKEW)
    - padre-client allows you to use Padre for commit messages and other
      synchronous edit events (CORION)
    - WIN32, Converted the --desktop registry code to Win32::TieRegistry 
      and removed hardcoded strawberry paths (AZAWAWI)
    - WIN32, padre.exe will run with the same UAC privileges as same as
      the invoker (AZAWAWI)
    - Disable debugger menu items when there is no document (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed a Padre debugger crash when unsaved document is debugged (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed Padre no-document crash with Find Next/Find Previous functionality
      (AZAWAWI)
    - Make sure that windows context key shows the refactor menu 
      items in the right-click pop-up menu (AZAWAWI)
    - Used Module::CoreList::is_deprecated to display deprecated CORE modules
      in help search title (AZAWAWI)
    - Padre::Util::Win32::ExecuteProcessAndWait doesn't automatically inherit
      the same Cwd as the parent process. Added support for explicit cwd
      parameter and make the syntax checker pass the cwd to it. Syntax checking
      of test scripts and such should now work as intended on Win32(ADAMK)
    - Audit uses of Padre::Util::Win32 to only load it via require. Added a
      TRACE warning to verify it never gets loaded on non-Win32 (ADAMK)
    - Tuned the locking for ->close_where, which should make a variety of
      functions like "Close This Project" and "Close Other Projects"
      noticably faster (ADAMK)
    - Changed func_foo config variables to feature_foo, in anticipation of
      of a future equivalent to the Mozilla "about:config" control (ADAMK)
    - Added feature_cursormemory to allow disabling of Padre's feature to
      remember the location in the file you were scrolled to (ADAMK)
    - Added a fast ascii shortcut to the very slow encode detector. Opening
      files all of a sudden gets much faster if you have ascii files (ADAMK)
    - Bumped ORLite to 1.38 to get faster ARRAY object support and
      Class::XSAccessor acceleration support. If they cause problems,
      these changes can be safely backed out. (ADAMK)
    - Fixed the mass-error-popups on mimetypes without help provider (SEWI)
    - During DB locks (which are the most likely place for things to make
      changes to the database) disable synchronous SQLite writes. This will
      reduce the time that Padre blocks, at the risk of config.db corruption
      if there is a hardware failure or operating system crash. (ADAMK)

      ->Destroy could lead to a Padre crash on WIN32 (AZAWAWI)

    - dist-zilla projects detection finally fixed (#489) (JQUELIN)
    - The directory tree refresh method will shortcut if nothing has
      changed, which should fix a number of bugs relating to the
      directory tree "doing things" when it shouldn't be (ADAMK)
    - Saving files to somewhere other than the current project will now
      correctly flush the document project state, and triggers a directory
      tree flush so that we communicate the change in project (ADAMK)
    - Cloned ORLite::Migrate to a private version as Padre::DB::Migrate
      so we have a better chance of fixing bug #796 (ADAMK)
    - Tentatively fixed #796 by spawning migration scripts in a manner which
      does NOT assume the pre-existance of STDOUT. This is at best a
      short-term hack, because this STDOUT problem is going to come back and
      bite us in other ways in the future, for sure (ADAMK)
    - Tuned the directory tree refresh logic to improve startup speed when
      launching Padre with specific named files to open (ADAMK)

      methods that are also contained in higher level refresh methods.

      Padre::Desktop. Desktop link creation works on Vista and newer
      operating systems again (ADAMK)
    - Tuned menubar refresh to only fire if we change document mimetype,
      which saves a ton of CPU and seems to reduce flicker (ADAMK)

0.54 2010.01.07
    - Added experimental support for clickable filenames in Output panel.
      Currently only matches: <error> at <file> line 5. (PDONELAN)

      permanently and never come back. Resolved (ADAMK)
    - Fix perl interpreter selection (SZABGAB)
    - Updated DBD::SQLite dependency to 1.27 and ORLite dependency to 1.30.
      This should now correctly throw an exception on a corrupt padre.db file
      which will cause an immediate crash at startup with a SQLite-related
      error message instead of a secondary error message complaining about
      missing Padre::DB classes (ADAMK)
    - Moved Padre::HelpProvider::Perl to Padre::Document::Perl::Help to
      prevent plugin classes from being scattered all over the namespace
      tree (ADAMK)

      to prevent plugin classes from being scattered all over the namespace
      tree (ADAMK)
    - During shutdown, be more precise about the order in which we clean up
      and be more careful to ensure that ->Update is NOT disabled, to prevent
      segfaults on Windows from the "disabled update at exit" bug (ADAMK)
    - Added the first PROJECT-backend config_perltidy setting, so that
      projects can for the first time define a project tidy policy. This
      project-specific policy isn't being used by the plugin itself yet,
      but this change clears the way for that kind of functionality (ADAMK)
    - Added config_perlcritic configuration setting, so that projects can
      define perlcritic policies (ADAMK)
    - All tests now run without the need for a visible Padre window (ADAMK)
    - Ticket #756: Wx::Perl::ProcessStream 0.24 solved this issue

      default always to Scintilla (AZAWAWI)
    - Landed new multi-resource locking subsystem. Many operations are now
      prevented from refreshing the GUI multiple times. Startup, shutdown,
      open and close multiple files, session changing all much faster (ADAMK)
    - In Open resource, path is now cleaned from slashes on win32 (AZAWAWI)
    - Fixed Padre crash when closing a Perl 5 script tab quickly while syntax
      check is on (AZAWAWI)

      checker. (AZAWAWI)

      (very basic) nested transactions (ADAMK)
    - Audited the startup process for database operations that either weren't
      being done in a transaction, or were doing crazy bizarre things. Startup
      is now noticably faster (ADAMK)
    - Added Preference setting to control autocomplete when editting a
      script rather than a Module. (PLAVEN)

      uses the last-used order (SEWI)
    - Fix: Double click on the function list jumps to the sub (again) now (SEWI)

      file wherever Padre is confident it is appropriate (ADAMK)
    - New file creation is now driven by Template Toolkit templates (using
      Template::Tiny). This should allow even basic new file creation to be
      somewhat adaptive to the user or project context (ADAMK)
    - Padre speedup: Limit number of menu bar refreshs (SEWI)
    - Fixed ticket #790: Ctrl + Caps Lock reduces font size (AZAWAWI)
