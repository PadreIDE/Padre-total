README for padre.exe

This is Padre's win32 launcher. It tries to find padre in its executable path, 
then runs it as wperl.exe padre_exe_path\padre. If it doesnt find it, it simply 
shows a message box and exits.

To compile it, please use compile_padre.bat. You'll ofcourse need Strawberry 
Perl as it has gcc, strip, and windres out of the box.

padre.exe now lives in Padre/script
