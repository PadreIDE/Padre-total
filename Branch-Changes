  - first commit on new branch alot of things trialed, like a toolbar in the main window - FAIL
  - Worked on the first improvement to the SVN GUI stuff and that's a LogDialog.pm
    LogDialog is a nicer way to show the log information for a file using a text control that allows scolling, rather than the current 
    dialog with a lot of text that disappears off the screen.
