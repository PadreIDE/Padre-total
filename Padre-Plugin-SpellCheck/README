NAME
    Padre::Plugin::SpellCheck - Check spelling in Padre, The Perl IDE.

VERSION
    version 1.30

DESCRIPTION
    For Padre 0.97+

    This plug-in allows one to check there spelling within Padre using "F7"
    (standard spelling short-cut across text processors).

    One can change the dictionary language used (based upon install
    languages) in the preferences window via Plug-in Manager. Note that
    preferences can only be setup while the plugin is disabled. Preferences
    are persistent. You need to Save your preferred language.

    This plug-in is using "Text::Aspell" default (legacy). You can also use
    "Text::Hunspell", so check these module's pod for more information and
    install the one for you.

    Of course, you need to have the relevant Dictionary binary, dev and
    dictionary installed.

SYNOPSIS
        Check your file or selected text for spelling errors in your preferred language.
        F7

  Spell checking methods
    *
     spell_check()

     Spell checks the current selection (or the whole document).

BUGS and LIMITATIONS
    If you upgrade your os, and run Perl from a local/lib, you may find
    Hunspell stops showing local dictionary s in preferences, you will need
    to un-install Text::Hunspell and re-install in cpan.

    Spell-checking non-ascii files has bugs: the selection does not match
    the word boundaries, and as the spell checks moves further in the
    document, offsets are totally irrelevant. This is a bug in
    "Wx::StyledTextCtrl" that has some Unicode problems... So unfortunately,
    there's nothing that I can do in this plug-in to tackle this bug.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests to "padre-plugin-spellcheck
    at rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
    "/rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Padre-Plugin- SpellCheck" in
    http:. I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of
    progress on your bug as I make changes.
