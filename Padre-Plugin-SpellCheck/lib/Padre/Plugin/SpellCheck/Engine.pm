=head1 NAME

Padre::Plugin::SpellCheck::Engine - spell engine for plugin



=head1 DESCRIPTION



=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item my $engine = PPS::Engine->new;

Create a new engine to be used later on.


=back



=head2 Instance methods

=over 4

=item * my ($word, $pos) = $engine->check( $text );

Spell check C<$text> (according to current speller), and return the
first error encountered (undef if no spelling mistake). An error is
reported as the faulty C<$word>, as well as the C<$pos> of the word in
the text (position of the start of the faulty word).


=item * $engine->ignore( $word );

Tell engine to ignore C<$word> for rest of the spell check.


=item * my @dictionaries = $engine->dictionaries;

Return a (reduced) list of dictionaries installed with aspell. The
names returned are the dictionary locale names (eg C<en_US>). Note
that only plain locales are reported, the variations coming with
aspell are stripped.


=item * my @suggestions = $engine->suggestions( $word );

Return suggestions for C<$word>.
