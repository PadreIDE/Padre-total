=head1 NAME

Padre::Wx::App - Padre main Wx application abstraction

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For architectural clarity, L<Padre> maintains two separate collections
of resources, a Wx object tree representing the literal GUI elements,
and a second tree of objects representing the abstract concepts, such
as configuration, projects, and so on.

B<Padre::Wx::App> is a L<Wx::App> subclass that represents the Wx
application as a whole, and acts as the root of the object tree for
the GUI elements.

From the main L<Padre> object, it can be accessed via the C<wx> method.
