=head1 NAME

Padre::Wx::App - Padre main Wx application abstraction

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For architectural clarity, L<Padre> maintains two separate collections
of resources, a Wx object tree representing the literal GUI elements,
and a second tree of objects representing the abstract concepts, such
as configuration, projects, and so on.

Theoretically, this should allow Padre to run automated processes of
various types without having to bootstrap a process up into an entire
30+ megabyte Wx-capable instance.

B<Padre::Wx::App> is a L<Wx::App> subclass that represents the Wx
application as a whole, and acts as the root of the object tree for
the GUI elements.

From the main L<Padre> object, it can be accessed via the C<wx> method.
