=head2 new

  my $object = Padre::Wx::Progress->new($title, $max_count,
               message => $default_message # optional
               modal => 1, # optional
               lazy  => 1, # optional
               );

The C<new> constructor lets you create a new C<Padre::Wx::Progress> object.

C<$title> is the title of the new box.

C<$max_count> contains the highest item-number being processed.

Options:

A default message could be set (in case C<update> should be called without text)
with the message key. This is overridden by the newest C<update> text.
Default is an empty message.

Set modal to true to lock other application windows while the progress
box is displayed. Default is 0 (non-modal).

Set lazy to true to show the progress dialog only if the whole process
takes long enough that the progress box makes sense. Default if 1 (lazy-mode).

All options are optional, Padre will use fixed defaults if they're missing.

Returns a new C<Padre::Wx::Progress> or dies on error.

=head2 update

  $progress->update($value,$text);

Updates the progress bar with a new value and optional with a new text message.

The last message will stay if no new text is specified.
