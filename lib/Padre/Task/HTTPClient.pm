=head1 NAME

Padre::Task::HTTPClient - HTTP client for Padre

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Padre::Task::HTTPClient provies a common API for HTTP access to Padre.

As we don't want a specific HTTP client module dependency to a
network-independent application like Padre, this module searches
for installed HTTP client modules and uses one of them.

If none of the "child" modules could be loaded (no HTTP support at all
on this computer), it fails and returns nothing (scalar undef).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $http = Padre::Task::HTTPClient->new();

The C<new> constructor lets you create a new B<Padre::Task::HTTPClient> object.

Returns a new B<Padre::Task::HTTPClient> or dies on error.

=cut

sub new {

	my $class = shift;

	my %args = @_;

	return if ( !defined( $args{URL} ) ) or ( $args{URL} eq '' );

	# Prepare information
	$args{headers}->{'X-Padre'} ||= 'Padre version ' . $VERSION . ' ' . Padre::Util::revision();
	$args{method} ||= 'GET';

	my $self;

	# Each module will be tested and the first working one should return
	# a object, all others should return nothing (undef)
	for ('LWP') {
		require 'Padre/Task/HTTPClient/' . $_ . '.pm';
		$self = "Padre::Task::HTTPClient::$_"->new(%args);
		next unless defined($self);
		return $self;
	}

	return;

}

#=head2 atime
#
#  $file->atime;
#
#Returns the last-access time of the file.
#
#This is usually not possible for non-local files, in these cases, undef
#is returned.
#
#=cut
#
## Fallback if the module has no such function:
#sub atime {
#	return;
#}
