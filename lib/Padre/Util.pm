=head1 NAME

Padre::Util - Padre Utility Functions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Padre::Util package is a internal storage area for miscellaneous
functions that aren't really Padre-specific that we want to throw
somewhere it won't clog up task-specific packages.

All functions are exportable and documented for maintenance purposes,
but except for in the Padre core distribution you are discouraged in
the strongest possible terms for relying on these functions, as they
may be moved, removed or changed at any time without notice.

# Padre targets three major platforms.
# 1. Native Win32
# 2. Mac OS X
# 3. GTK Unix/Linux
# The following defined reusable constants for these platforms,
# suitable for use in platform-specific adaptation code.

use constant WIN32 => !! ( $^O eq 'MSWin32' );
use constant MAC   => !! ( $^O eq 'darwin'  );
use constant UNIX  => !  ( WIN32 or MAC );
