=head1 NAME

Padre::Manual - The Primary Padre Documentation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a stub for what will eventually become the Padre manual.

Currently this serves as a launch point for each of the child documents
that make up the nascent "manual".

=head2 Padre Development Guide

If you would like to help improve Padre see L<Padre::Manual::Hacking> for
information on checking out Padre, how to work with it, file bugs, etc.

=head2 Padre Translation Guild

If you would like to translate Padre into your local language, see
L<Padre::Manual::Translation> for more information.

This is currently VERY new and does not have much useful information in it.
(That should hopefully change shortly).
