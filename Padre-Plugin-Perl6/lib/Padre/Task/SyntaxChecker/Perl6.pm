Padre::Task::SyntaxChecker::Perl6 - Perl document syntax-checking in the background

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # by default, the text of the current document
  # will be fetched as will the document's notebook page.
  my $task = Padre::Task::SyntaxChecker::Perl6->new(
    newlines => "\r\n", # specify the newline type!
  );
  $task->schedule;
  
  my $task2 = Padre::Task::SyntaxChecker::Perl6->new(
    text => Padre::Current->document->text_get,
    notebook_page => Padre::Current->document->editor,
    on_finish => sub { my $task = shift; ... },
    newlines => "\r\n", # specify the newline type!
  );
  $task2->schedule;

=head1 DESCRIPTION
