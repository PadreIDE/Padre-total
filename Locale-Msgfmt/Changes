0.09    unreleased
        - still require the newer version of Locale::Maketext::Gettext

        - again remove the dependency on Locale::Maketext::Gettext,

0.07    Jun 26, 2009
        - make the interface a bit nicer

          the input file is a directory)
        - more tests
        - always build_require Locale::Maketext::Gettext, now it will
          install correctly
        - improved POD
        - switch the "sample" translation used for the tests to
          japanese instead of french, since the japanese includes
          copyright and license information
