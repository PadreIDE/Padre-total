[Who]
 <p>
Using Perl since 2001 and uploading to <acronym>CPAN</acronym> since 2003. I participate in
Perl community sites and some Perl projects. Also trying to build a career
on Perl.
 </p>

[Why]
<p>
Having an <acronym>IDE</acronym> written in Perl is something you can't help participating.
It is possible to extend and fix errors using the language I like the most.
