[Why]
<p>I've always wanted an editor with deep Perl integration. This project also 
satisfies my curiosity for cross-platform GUI apps.
</p>

[What]
<p>I've taken the lead in making sure the PerlTidy plugin follows all of the 
new developments in the Padre-sphere. Next on the docket, a settings dialog 
to customize your PerlTidy settings.</p>
