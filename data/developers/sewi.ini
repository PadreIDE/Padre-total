[Who]
<p>developing since 1988 and using Perl since 1995</p>

[Why]
<p>I was looking for a graphical editor or <acronym>IDE</acronym> for developing Perl during
summer holidays 2009. Padre satisfied nearly all of my requirements, it was
much faster than some other and I loved the idea to be able to change the
source as needed but I didn't plan to really join the developer team due to
time issues.</p>
<p>I went to IRC to report a small bug and GÃ¡bor made me walking through the
code fixing it myself but he finally trapped me by rejecting the Trac upload
and making me commit it myself.
</p>

[What]
<p>Some smaller changes, fighting tickets and bugs and trying to convert IRC visitors
into Padre developers.
</p>
