[Why]
<p>10 years as an Ultraedit user have seen me go from enthusiast,
to ordinary user, to (attempted) contributor, to disgruntled user. It's
a great text editor, but for Perl developers the situation never
improves. Despite years of bug reporting and attempts to make my own
situation better, flaws that existed a decade ago continue to annoy me
regularly.<br />
Over the last few years years, I've known that all the elements of a
good <acronym>CPAN</acronym>-hosted <acronym>IDE</acronym> were in place (Wx, Scintilla, <acronym>PPI</acronym>) and tried to
encourage someone to build one (because I didn't have the time to lead
it).<br />
By the time GÃ¡bor took the initiative and started Padre, I was more
than ready to leave Ultraedit and move to an editor that I actually
have some control over.<br />
The sense of empowerment you get from being able to fix your own editor is the ultimate feature.<br />
</p>

[What]
<p>I follow behind all
the creative feature-production people doing destructive refactoring
and generally breaking everything. I'm responsible for the
configuration, locale, database, search, and document subsystems.<br />
<br />
