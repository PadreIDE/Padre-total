[Who]
<p>has been using Perl since 1995 and teaching it since 2000. 
He has been involved in the Perl community since 2001 organizing
local Perl Monger meetings and conferences. Gabor is providing
Perl development and training services bot in in-house automation
and test automation. </p>

[Why]
<p>
I started the development of Padre as I wanted to create an editor
for people who don't know Perl yet and for people who use Perl
only as an add-on tool and thus even after several years of usage
are not very familiar with the language, its special cases and CPAN.</p>
<p>
I knew I cannot do that alone so I decided to try to make it interesting 
enough for hard-core Perl developers to give it a try, to use it at
least in some special cases or to manage large projects and to help in 
the development.
</p>
<p>
I also hope Padre can be a springboard to learn Perl 6.
</p>
<p>
I used to use vim and gvim both on 
Linux and Windows but since the first release of Padre I have been
using it almost exclusively.
</p>

[What]
<p>
Everything a bit but mostly I am trying to get more people involved.
