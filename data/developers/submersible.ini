[Who]
 <p> is still exercising the liberty to not run a homepage, twitter, blog etc.</p>

[Why]
<p>
Stunned at what had already been achieved with Padre 0.2, I felt it deserved
the momentum. I am compelled to make the Pod/doc browser work respectably, which
has turned into a serious yak shaving experience. I seem to yell, shout or
otherwise vent anger at software – a lot. Channelling that rage into code is
far more productive.
</p>

[What]
<p>
Padre::DocBrowser and its guts, the replacement of PodFrame. Lots of differing ways to search and index data,
<a href="http://marvinhumphrey.com/kinosearch/docs/devel/">KinoSearch</a>
is looking very promising and in Perl terms PPI and Pod-Abstract are my new
best friends. Currently bit bashing and string mashing an index of
 <a href="http://cpants.perl.org/static/cpants_all.db.gz">this</a> just for fun.
</p>
<p>Playing in the Padre::Swarm sandpit – mainly for fun.</p>
