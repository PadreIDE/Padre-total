[Who]
<p>I am primarily an emacs user because I mostly program/edit things
that are not written in Perl, but I like being spoiled by the cool
toys in Padre. ;)</p>


[Why]
<p>I kind of just started.. :). Anyway, I enjoy contributing because
the community is nice, puts up with me and my lack of knowledge about
CPAN and Wx, and I'm learning new things.</p>

[What]
<p>So far I have created Locale-Msgfmt to handle compiling
translations for Padre and the plugins, and I wrote the REPL plugin. I
am also working on packaging the plugins for Debian (and Ubuntu), and
am a co-maintainer of Padre in Debian.</p>
