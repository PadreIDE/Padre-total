[Why]
<p>
I've been using Emacs since the mid-90s (although I'm no expert) and have never been able to find anything else I can work happily with, but Emacs Lisp makes my brain hurt, and cperl-mode struggles with the increasingly large and complex Perl applications I've been building recently - I'm looking for an alternative.<br/>
Because Padre is easily extensible in a language I speak almost natively (Perl), and because it's lighter and faster than most of the other GUI editors I've tried, it's not only my best hope of replacing Emacs, but also fun and immediately rewarding to hack on both the editor itself and plug-ins.</p>
<p>Although I don't use Padre for day-to-day development, I will be soon - once I'm happy with version control integration and Emacs key mapping, I'll be switching to it full time (which is 7.5 hours a day, 340 days a year).
</p>

[What]
<p>I've done some small mods to Padre itself to enable further work on key mapping in plug-ins, I'm working on the EmacsMode plug-in that provides Emacs style key mapping, and plan on integrating <a href="http://www.aarontrevena.co.uk/opensource/autodia/index.html">Autodia</a> through another plug-in some time soon.
