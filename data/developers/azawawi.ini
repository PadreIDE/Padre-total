[Who]
 <p>
 I am a full-time Java programmer who enjoys playing with Perl in his 
 free time. I like the creative freedom, challenges and valuable experience 
 that open source projects provide to programmers out there for FREE!
 </p>

[Why]
<p>
 I was working on a Perl 6 syntax highlighter when i heard about 
 Gabor's TPF Perl 6 Grant. Naturally, i offered to help out and now i am the 
 co-maintainer of Padre::Plugin::Perl6 with him. My goal is to co-develop a 
 state-of-the-art Perl 6 IDE.
</p>

[What]
<p>
I am re-writing Syntax::Highlight::Perl6 to provide better PPI-like API. 
Afterwards, we can provide better Perl 6 refactoring support. 
I also wrote Padre::Plugin::Ecliptic to support my ambitious goal of porting 
useful Eclipse features into Padre.
