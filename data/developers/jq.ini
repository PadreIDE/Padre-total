[Who]
<p>is enjoying programming Perl</p>

[Why]
 <p>
I've been long using vi, then Emacs, then vi again. I always wanted a
Perl <acronym>IDE</acronym> designed around Perl programming – and not added as an
afterthought. Padre has a huge potential with respect to this expectation. Being
programmed in Perl allows me to fix what i dislike in it…
 </p>

[What]
 <p>
When I'm working on Padre (which happens in bursts), I'm touching a lot
of different parts of the code base: the plug-in manager and the sessions
are my fault, so is the i18n plug-in <acronym>API</acronym>. I'm fixing stuff that annoys
me, try to sanitize fishy stuff (removing circular dependencies, etc.)
and document things that I'm forced to dig into… generally, I'm
checking the bug tracker on a regular basis and try to pick and close
random bugs. I also contributed a few plug-ins, and maintain Padre's
French translation.
