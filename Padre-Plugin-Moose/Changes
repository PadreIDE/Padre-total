Changes for Padre-Plugin-Moose

0.12  2012.2.26 (AZAWAWI)

	  No actual deletion is done at the moment
	- Add the UI/event hooks for constructor/destructor buttons.
	  No code generation at the moment
	- Choice combo list is now in inspector. (bowtie++ for the idea)

0.11  2012.2.24 (AZAWAWI)
	- New polished dialog UI :)
	- Added method modifiers (around, before, after)
	- Removed About button and moved its information to the dialog title

0.10  2012.2.24 (AZAWAWI)
	- Fixed future timestamp for recently released 0.09. Stupid old dev VM
	  image :)

0.09  2012.2.24 (AZAWAWI)
	- Escape regular expression while positioning the preview editor
	- Current editor theme is always applied. 
	- No need to hide controls. Let us do the right way and validate each action (bowtie++).
	- Use Moose sugar 'blessed' instead of Scalar::Util::blessed - which is the same but cooler :)
	- Fixed ellipsis in plugin manager (bowtie++)
	- Stop doing that grid focus automatically. It screws up navigation
	- Various POD updates regarding methods.
	- Clicking on a tree element scrolls to the first line of its generated code instead of the Padre-default centerize
	- About dialog is reusing ->message() and is modal friendly
	- ::Main now does('Padre::Wx::Role::Dialog'). Alias++
	- ::Role::CanHandleInspector now requires 'get_grid_data'. No global %INSPECTOR in ::Main
	- has 'attribute'; # is now supported, no default values. Just the basics :) Better attribute/subtype code generation
	- Each tree element knows how to handle the inspector via ::Role::CanHandleInspector
	- Various name refactoring and more roles in ::Role namespace
