README for padre.exe

This is Padre's win32 launcher. It does the following:
	* Tries to find wperl.exe in the executable path. If it fails, it exits 
		with a message.
	* Tries to find padre script in the executable path. If it fails, it exits 
		with a message.
	* Runs %padre_exe_path%\wperl.exe %padre_exe_path%\padre.

To compile it, simply 'perl Makefile.PL' or 'cpan .' in the parent folder. You'll
ofcourse need Strawberry Perl as it has gcc and windres out of the box.
