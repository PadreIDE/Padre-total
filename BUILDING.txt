It is assumed that unzip and svn are available.

You can download unzip from 
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html
and svn from http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#windows

It is also assumed that LWP, Archive::Tar and IO::Compress::Gzip are installed.
(this is the case for any Strawberry Perl distribution.)

rem Setup CPAN environment variable to point to you choice of CPAN mirror
set CPAN=http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/pub/CPAN
rem or the 5-min CPAN mirror
set CPAN=http://cpan.hexten.net

You really need to use a Bootstrap installation for these steps, 
because at the end of this, this will install into c:\strawberry, and you can't 
overwrite the host perl.

A usable Bootstrap build is at 
http://strawberryperl.com/download/bootstrap/bootstrap-perl-5.10.1.1.msi, or you 
can build one yourself by going "perldist Bootstrap" once steps 2 and 3 are done.

1) To speed up the build, we either need to get (1a) or build (1b) a .par file for
Alien::wxWidgets.

NOTE: There used to be a requirement that the steps in 1b were performed in a 
Strawberry build, because Alien::wxWidgets hard-coded the library locations.
Version 0.46 removed this problem (it adjusts the location on the fly.)

1a) Getting the Alien::wxWidgets .par file.

cd C:\
lwp-download http://www.commandline.co.uk/mtee/mtee.zip
unzip mtee.zip
lwp-download http://www.strawberryperl.com/download/padre/Alien-wxWidgets-0.50-MSWin32-x86-multi-thread-5.10.1.par

1b) [Only needed if an updated version of Alien::wxWidgets is wanted from the one
above] Create a par file for Alien::wxWidgets.

rem Setup which version of Alien wxWidgets to use
set ALIEN_WIDGETS=Alien-wxWidgets-0.50

cd C:\
lwp-download http://www.commandline.co.uk/mtee/mtee.zip
unzip mtee.zip
lwp-download %CPAN%/authors/id/M/MB/MBARBON/%ALIEN_WIDGETS%.tar.gz
ptar -x -z -f %ALIEN_WIDGETS%.tar.gz
cd %ALIEN_WIDGETS%
perl Makefile.PL
perl -MPAR::Dist -eblib_to_par
rem wait 40 minutes
copy Alien-*.par ..
cd ..

(NOTE: 0.46 and below used to require a patch in order to avoid warnings when linking the MSI.
This patch was incorporated into 0.46_01 and later versions of Alien::wxWidgets.)

2) Install Alien::WiX and Perl::Dist::WiX from CPAN.
3) Install Perl::Dist::Strawberry from CPAN.

rem say [y] install minicpan script ... This is important for optional step 5a
cpan Alien::WiX Perl::Dist::WiX Perl::Dist::Strawberry

4) Install Perl::Dist::Padre from svn or from CPAN. SVN directions are below.

rem --- install via CPAN
cpan Perl::Dist::Padre

rem ---- or install from SVN
cpan parent
svn co https://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/Perl-Dist-Padre
cd Perl-Dist-Padre
perl Makefile.PL && dmake && dmake test
dmake install
cd ..

4a) (Optional) If you want to build off a minicpan, do this:

minicpan_pdwix --dist Perl-Dist-Padre --minicpan C:\Padre-minicpan\ --cpan %CPAN%

5) Actually build the dist...

set PERL_DIST_PADRE_ALIENWXWIDGETS_PAR_LOCATION=C:\Alien-wxWidgets-0.50-MSWin32-x86-multi-thread-5.10.1.par
rem to make sure the path is correct
dir %PERL_DIST_PADRE_ALIENWXWIDGETS_PAR_LOCATION%

rem --- without minicpan (4a)
perldist_w Padre --cpan %CPAN% 2>&1 | mtee padre-install.txt
(wait for 1-3 hours)

rem --- with minicpan (4a)
perldist_w Padre --cpan file://C:/Padre-minicpan/ 2>&1 | mtee padre-install.txt

[If you want more information during the build, put "--trace 2" between "perldist_w" and "Padre" 

Build Troubleshooting
---------------------
%TEMP%/perldist/output contains the output of the last command that has been run. 
(whenever a perl, dmake, or Build.bat command is run, the output is in 
debug.out and debug.err files in that directory.)
