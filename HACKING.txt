Hacking


This file should inculde some information that is only relevant to 
those who want to develop Padre. We assume that they will all work in
a workspace checked out from the SVN repository.

Some extra files we have in the SVN repository that don't get distributed:

dev.pl      is just a wrapper script to launch script/padre the main executable of 
            setting some environment variables.

release.pl  is a script used only before releasing Padre to check and set version numbers
            it will have to be improved to create a real release script maybe based on
            Dist::Zilla


Translation file

Currently we are using gettext so we have a po file for each additional
language (currently only German) in the share/locale/ directory.

Before release we have to generate an mo file by typing

  msgfmt -o share/locale/de.mo share/locale/de.po
