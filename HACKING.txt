Hacking


This file should inculde some information that is only relevant to 
those who want to develop Padre. We assume that they will all work in
a workspace checked out from the SVN repository.

Extra files
------------

Some extra files we have in the SVN repository that don't get distributed:


dev.pl      is just a wrapper script to launch script/padre the main executable of 
            setting some environment variables.

release.pl  is a script used only before releasing Padre to check and set version numbers
            it will have to be improved to create a real release script maybe based on
            Dist::Zilla


Translation files
-----------------

Currently we are using gettext so we have a po file for each additional
language (currently only German) in the share/locale/ directory.

Before release we have to generate an mo file by typing

  msgfmt -o share/locale/de.mo share/locale/de.po



Version control
----------------
You probably already know that we use Subversion and it is located
at http://svn.perlide.org/

Bug tracking and Feature requests
----------------------------------
We are using Trac for this. The main web site of Padre is actually its
trac http://padre.perlide.org/


Patching
--------
Check out the trunk, http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/
and use svn diff to create your patch while your current
working directory is  the trunk directory.

Please send patches either to the padre-dev mailing list or
add them to trac.
